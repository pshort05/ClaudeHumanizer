# ClaudeHumanizer

**‚ö†Ô∏è Optimized for Claude Sonnet 4.5 (Recommended) | Also supports: Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-5**

A professional AI text humanization system using a specialized 10-phase assembly line to transform AI-generated content into natural, human-like writing while preserving meaning and voice.

## Overview

ClaudeHumanizer employs a **domain-specialized assembly line** where each phase targets one specific aspect of text improvement. This systematic approach eliminates AI detection markers while maintaining quality through:

- **Sequential processing** - Each phase builds on previous improvements
- **Domain isolation** - No phase interferes with others' specialized work
- **Pattern-based filtering** - Intelligent rules for dialogue pauses, light descriptions, finger movements
- **Master prohibited list** - Prevents reintroduction of AI-associated terms
- **Final quality control** - Phase 10 catches prohibited words reintroduced by phases 3-9
- **Silent operation** - Returns improved text without commentary

## Quick Start

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Usage Considerations

**Non-Native English Speaker (NNES) Bias Warning**
AI detectors exhibit documented bias against non-native English speakers. NNES writing often features simpler sentence structures, more limited vocabulary, and reliance on common phrasings‚Äîcharacteristics that detectors may misclassify as AI-generated.

**Important**: If you are processing text originally written by an NNES writer, be aware that:
- The humanization process may inadvertently simplify vocabulary and sentence structures further
- Some NNES writing patterns are naturally similar to AI patterns (limited lexical diversity, common phrases)
- Over-processing NNES text through all phases might make it appear MORE AI-like to certain detectors
- Consider selectively applying phases rather than the full pipeline for NNES-authored content

**Hybrid Text (Human + AI) Guidance**
AI detectors often fail catastrophically on hybrid texts containing both human and AI-generated content, frequently misclassifying them as either 100% human or 100% AI with no middle ground.

**Important**: This system assumes 100% AI-generated input. If you have hybrid text:
- Manually identify which sections are human-written vs AI-generated
- Only process the AI-generated sections through the pipeline
- Keep human-written sections completely untouched
- Do NOT run mixed human/AI paragraphs through the system‚Äîprocess them separately
- Consider whether detection is even a concern if substantial human contribution exists

### Model Selection (October 2025)

**Choose your LLM based on priorities:**

| Model | Best For | Cost | Key Advantage |
|-------|----------|------|---------------|
| **Claude Sonnet 4.5** ‚≠ê | Maximum quality | $3-15/1M tokens | "Surgical" edits, natural human tone, best instruction-following |
| **Gemini 2.5 Pro** üí∞ | Budget/Long texts | $1.25-15/1M tokens | 40% cheaper, 1M context, fastest (372 tok/s) |
| **GPT-5** üîÑ | ChatGPT users | Subscription | Literary style, widely available (requires stricter prompting) |

**Quick Decision:**
- **Quality priority?** ‚Üí Claude Sonnet 4.5 (recommended)
- **Budget priority or text >100K words?** ‚Üí Gemini 2.5 Pro
- **Already have ChatGPT Plus?** ‚Üí GPT-5 (with cautions)

### Basic Workflow

1. **Download required files**: 10 phase prompts + `master_prohibited_words.json`
2. **Select your model**: Claude Sonnet 4.5 (recommended), Gemini 2.5 Pro (budget), or GPT-5
3. **Process sequentially**: Phase 1 ‚Üí 2 ‚Üí 3 ‚Üí 4 ‚Üí 5 ‚Üí 6 ‚Üí 7 ‚Üí 8 ‚Üí 9 ‚Üí (9.5 optional) ‚Üí 10
4. **Include master list**: Required for phases 2 and 10 (contains pattern rules)
5. **Use previous output**: Each phase processes the result from the previous phase
6. **Temperature settings**: Use temperature 1.0 for Phase 6 (dialogue), standard temps for others

### Execution Methods

#### Manual Processing
Copy each phase prompt into Claude Sonnet 4.5 with appropriate dependencies:

```
For phases 2 and 10:

### Optional Enhancements

**Phase 6.1**: `6.1_character_dialogue_pass.json` - Character-specific dialogue customization for targeted voice refinement (see [Customization Guide](docs/CUSTOMIZATION.md))

**Phase 9.5**: `9.5_statistical_analysis_hub.json` - **COMPREHENSIVE STATISTICAL HUB** consolidating all quantitative metrics (burstiness, POS distribution, lexical diversity/TTR) into single-pass analysis. Use when AI detection is a concern or text needs statistical optimization. Provides optional detailed metrics report.

## Key Features

### ‚úÖ Architectural Clarity (NEW)
**Clear Separation of Concerns:**
- **Phase 9**: QUALITATIVE pattern replacement (N-grams, formulaic phrases, AI patterns)
- **Phase 9.5**: QUANTITATIVE statistical optimization (burstiness, POS, TTR) - all metrics in one pass
- **Phase 10**: Pure WORD FILTERING (prohibited words only)

**Benefits:**
- Single-pass statistical analysis = more efficient
- Coordinated metric optimization = balanced results
- Clear conceptual boundaries = easier to understand and maintain
- Optional statistics phase = skip if text is already optimized

### ‚úÖ Domain Specialization
- Each phase handles exactly one improvement type
- Clear boundaries prevent interference between phases
- Specialized expertise for consistent results

### ‚úÖ Pattern-Based Intelligence
- **Dialogue Pause Rules** - Eliminates "weight of words", "silence stretched", etc.
- **Light Description Rules** - Replaces "filtering through", "casting shadows" with simple alternatives
- **Finger Action Rules** - Converts "fingers dancing" to direct action verbs like "typing"
- Pattern matching catches creative variations automatically

### ‚ú® NEW: Research-Based Detection Countermeasures
Based on academic AI detector research, ClaudeHumanizer now includes targeted countermeasures for the latest detection methods:

**Phase 3 - Nominalization Conversion** (v2.4.0)
- Converts AI's abstract nominalized constructions to direct verbal forms
- Example: "The implementation of the solution" ‚Üí "They implemented the solution"
- Addresses HIGH-priority detection marker explicitly identified in research

**Phase 8 - Punctuation Inconsistency Injection** (v4.1.0)
- Breaks AI's "machine-like consistency" in punctuation patterns
- Strategic Oxford comma variation, spacing inconsistencies, hyphenation variation
- Addresses detector-specific marker: perfect punctuation consistency

**Phase 8 - Enhanced Strategic Imperfections** (v4.1.0)
- Logical leap injection (removes over-explanation)
- Tangential thought insertion (breaks perfect linearity)
- Awkward phrasing retention (preserves authentic human voice)
- Minor typo injection (user-configurable for casual content)
- Addresses "counterintuitive perfection" detection signal

**Phase 9 - Cross-Document N-gram Filter** (v15.0.0)
- Eliminates 150+ common AI n-gram patterns (2-5+ word sequences)
- Examples: "it is important to note that", "plays a crucial role in", "in order to"
- Addresses N-gram frequency analysis used by advanced detectors

**Phase 9 - AI Pattern Detection** (v17.0.0) - REFACTORED
- Focuses on QUALITATIVE pattern replacement (N-grams, perplexity phrases)
- Removes formulaic expressions and predictable AI language patterns
- Statistical metrics moved to Phase 9.5 for consolidated analysis

**Phase 9.5 - Statistical Analysis Hub** (v2.0.0) - **NEW ARCHITECTURE**
- **Consolidates ALL quantitative metrics** into single comprehensive pass
- **Burstiness**: Sentence variation (CV, range, variance, complexity)
- **POS Distribution**: Noun/verb/adjective ratios normalized to human baselines (18-23% nouns, 16-20% verbs, 6-9% adjectives)
- **Lexical Diversity**: TTR calculation and vocabulary optimization (target 0.40-0.60)
- **Single-pass efficiency**: Reads text once, calculates all metrics, makes coordinated optimizations
- **Optional metrics report**: Detailed statistical analysis with before/after scores
- Addresses multiple detection vectors simultaneously with balanced optimization

**Phase 10 - Word Filtering Only** (v3.0.0) - SIMPLIFIED
- Pure prohibited word removal using master_prohibited_words.json
- No statistical analysis - focuses exclusively on word-level filtering
- Clean separation from statistical optimization (Phase 9.5)

### ‚ú® MEDIUM PRIORITY: Additional Detection Countermeasures

**Phase 7 - Active/Passive Voice Distribution Monitor** (v2.4.0)
- Analyzes active/passive voice ratios and normalizes to human baselines
- Targets: 85-90% active, 10-15% passive for narrative prose
- Prevents both excessive passive (early AI) and zero passive (over-correction)
- Addresses syntactic feature analysis used by detectors

**Phase 9 - Perplexity Optimizer** (v17.0.0)
- Systematically identifies and replaces low-perplexity (predictable) constructions
- Disrupts predictable collocations: "crystal clear" ‚Üí "obvious", "highly effective" ‚Üí "powerful"
- Replaces 30+ common business cliches and formulaic expressions
- Increases text unpredictability to reduce detection probability
- Now part of qualitative pattern detection (statistical metrics moved to 9.5)
