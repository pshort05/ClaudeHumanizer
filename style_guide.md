## Core Principles

**Show, don't tell** | **Use specific detail** | **Let characters drive action** | **Trust the reader**

---

## Critical Avoidances

### Dialogue & Voice
- ❌ "She whispered softly" / "he said harshly" → ✓ Use plain "said" or show tone through content
- ❌ "voice broke with emotion" → ✓ Show the break through dialogue itself
- ❌ Religious filler: "Oh God," "Jesus Christ," "Lord" → ✓ Use character-specific reactions

### Emotion Expression
- ❌ Generic escalation: "need crashed over her" / "walls crumbled" → ✓ Show specific consequence
- ❌ Mechanical body tells: "breath caught / hands trembled / jaw clenched" → ✓ Use them sparingly; prefer action
- ❌ "chemistry between them" / "electricity" → ✓ What specifically draws them? What do they notice?

### Description Shortcuts
- ❌ Template descriptors: "orbs," "pools of [color]," "column of neck," "sharp planes" → ✓ Describe actual appearance
- ❌ Elaborate light verbs: "sunlight filtered through" / "moonlight casting" → ✓ "in the moonlight" / "afternoon sun"
- ❌ Metaphor overuse: "cold dread," "heat pooled," "fire licked up spine" → ✓ Specific sensation or let it be invisible
- ❌ Finger dances: "fingers dancing across keyboard" → ✓ "typing" / "touched" / "traced"

### Narrative Shortcuts
- ❌ Time suspension: "world narrowed to" / "time stretched" / "everything else fell away" → ✓ Show what character focuses on
- ❌ Metaphorical pauses: "silence hung heavy" / "words stretched between them" → ✓ "Silence." / "Awkward silence." or delete
- ❌ Permission framing: "allowed herself to" / "permitted him to" → ✓ Character just does it
- ❌ Sudden realization: "clicked into place" / "clarity crashed" → ✓ Show understanding through action/dialogue

### Structure & Pacing
- ❌ Padding beats: "for a moment / for a beat / after a moment" → ✓ Just show the next action
- ❌ Possession/claiming language: "staked a claim" / "branded into" / "marked her" → ✓ Show specific behavior
- ❌ Summary endings: "nothing would ever be the same" / "everything had changed" → ✓ End on concrete moment

### Adult Content (Erotica)
- ❌ Euphemisms: "core," "passage," "opening," "folds," "breasts heaving" → ✓ Direct anatomical language
- ❌ Generic sensation: "heat pooled / wetness / throbbing" without specificity → ✓ Specific sensation + what character wants
- ❌ Mechanical verbs: "thrust / plunged / buried / drove" without character perspective → ✓ Show what's happening + how character experiences it
- ❌ Emotional distance: "he felt the power of watching her" → ✓ "He watched her face when she came, and he lost it."

### Genre-Specific (Romance)
- ❌ Emotional clichés: "something dark/dangerous in him" / "made her feel alive for the first time" → ✓ What specifically changes? What does he do?
- ❌ Vulnerability templates: "defenses crumbling / barriers fell / she came undone" → ✓ Show specific behavior shift
- ❌ Possession framing: "she was his / he was hers / she was undone" → ✓ Show what actually happens between them

## What TO Do Instead

1. **Use concrete detail**: What does it look like, sound like, feel like? Specifics create authenticity.
2. **Let dialogue reveal**: Character voice, conflict, and intimacy come through words, not descriptions.
3. **Show consequence**: When something changes, show what the character does differently, not what happened to their emotions.
4. **Trust the reader**: Don't label emotional impact. If you write it well, readers feel it.
5. **Use simple language**: Avoid sophisticated punctuation (em-dashes for effect), elaborate transitions, perfect flow. Real writing is often simple.
6. **Action drives meaning**: What characters do reveals who they are more than any description.

## Quick Checklist

Before finalizing:
- [ ] Dialogue uses plain "said" or shows tone through content
- [ ] No template descriptors or elaborate shortcuts
- [ ] Emotions shown through action/consequence, not stated
- [ ] No permission framing or time suspension language
- [ ] No mechanical body tells unless essential
- [ ] Adult content uses specific language, not euphemism
- [ ] No padding beats or filler phrases
- [ ] Endings land on concrete moments, not summaries

**Remember**: The strongest writing is specific, direct, and trusts the reader to understand. Strip away the machinery, and your authentic voice emerges.
