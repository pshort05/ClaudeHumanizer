feat(gemini-prompts): Integrate Chaos Method humanization strategies

This commit integrates key strategies from the "Chaos Method" into the Gemini humanization prompts to further reduce AI detection and enhance human-like authenticity.

Changes include:
- **Phase 3 (Advanced Structural & Statistical Humanization):**
  - Introduced "Kill the Rule of Three" to break symmetrical listing patterns.
  - Added "Inject Human Mess" to encourage parenthetical asides and rhetorical questions.
  - Reinforced elimination of "Insecure Paragraph Summaries."
- **Phase 2 (Stylistic & Narrative Enhancement):
  - Implemented "Cure the 'Vague Plague'" to force extreme specificity in descriptions.
- **Phase 1 (Foundational Cleanup):**
  - Added "Priority Ban List" to target high-frequency AI words like 'delve' and 'tapestry'.
  - Reinforced elimination of "Insecure Paragraph Summaries."

These updates aim to move generated text beyond merely "correct" AI prose to "authentically human" prose by embracing human irregularities and avoiding common AI tells.
