Implement Chaos Method humanization patterns across Phases 4, 5, and 8.5

Integrated key AI detection avoidance techniques from "Humanizing AI Writing &
The Chaos Method" document into the ClaudeHumanizer pipeline. These updates
address statistically measurable AI writing patterns that were not previously
detected by the system.

Phase 8.5 (Structural Construction Elimination): v1.0.0 → v1.1.0
- Added Pattern #30: Rule of Three Symmetry detection
  * AI defaults to three-item lists for artificial symmetry
  * HIGH priority detection marker - statistically measurable
  * Converts to 2, 4, or 5 items to break AI's symmetry preference
  * If keeping 3 items, makes third item awkward/unexpected
  * Examples: "fast, efficient, and reliable" → "fast and reliable" (2 items)
    or "fast, efficient, reliable, and surprisingly intuitive" (4 items)

- Added Pattern #31: Insecure Paragraph Summary detection
  * AI ends paragraphs by restating what was just said
  * MEDIUM-HIGH priority - clear AI authorship signal
  * Removes "Thus...", "Therefore...", "In conclusion..." endings
  * Principle: End when the point is made. Trust the reader.
  * Deletes redundant recap sentences that add no new information

- Updated pattern count from 29 to 31 throughout file
- Updated agent_directives, processing_instructions, quality_standards

Phase 4 (Sensory Enhancement): v2.2.0 → v2.3.0
- Added Extreme Specificity Strategy (new detection framework #5)
  * Replaces generic nouns with hyper-specific details
  * AI defaults to safe, generic descriptions (vehicle, building, phone)
  * Humans use specific make/model/year/condition/color
  * Examples:
    - "vehicle" → "rusted 1998 Honda Civic with a cracked windshield"
    - "building" → "three-story brick Victorian with chipped green shutters"
    - "phone" → "cracked iPhone 12 with a Star Wars case"
  * MEDIUM priority - generic nouns signal AI's vague universality
  * Forces creative hallucination that lowers AI detection rates

- Updated step_3_targeted_enhancement to include specificity guidance
- Applied only when enhancing flat passages (respects assembly line)

Phase 5 (Subtlety Creation): v2.3.0 → v2.4.0
- Added Redundant Paragraph Summaries detection pattern
  * CRITICAL priority - AI habitually adds insecure summaries
  * Detects final sentences that restate previous content
  * Removes sentences ending with transition words that signal recap
  * Comprehensive examples showing before/after transformations
  * Principle: Never end paragraphs/scenes/chapters with summaries

- Added to critical_fixes priority list
- Updated operational_instructions with deletion guidance
- Emphasizes trusting the reader vs. over-explaining

Technical Details:
- All version numbers updated with semantic versioning (MINOR bump)
- All dates updated to 2025-12-22
- Changes maintain backward compatibility with existing pipeline
- No modifications to master_prohibited_words.json required
- All updates respect assembly line domain isolation principles

Coverage Analysis:
The system now implements ALL key concepts from the Chaos Method:
✓ Vocabulary blacklist (master_prohibited_words.json)
✓ Burstiness/sentence variation (Phase 8)
✓ Rule of Three elimination (Phase 8.5 - NEW)
✓ Paragraph summary deletion (Phases 5 & 8.5 - NEW)
✓ Extreme specificity (Phase 4 - NEW)
✓ Formal transition replacement (Phase 7)
✓ Strategic imperfections (Phase 8)
✓ Perplexity optimization (Phase 9)

Files Modified:
- 8.5_structural_construction_elimination.json
- 4_sensory_enhancement.json
- 5_subtlety_creation.json
