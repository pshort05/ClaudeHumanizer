feat: Implement Gemini-optimized 4-stage humanizer workflow

This commit introduces a new, optimized 4-stage humanization pipeline specifically designed for the Google Gemini API. This new workflow consolidates the existing 11+ Claude phases into a more efficient, cost-effective, and powerful system leveraging Gemini's capabilities.

Key changes include:
- **New `gemini/` directory:** Created to house all Gemini-specific files.
- **Consolidated prompt files:**
    - `gemini/1_foundational_cleanup.json`: Combines grammar foundation, AI word cleaning, weak language cleanup, and final AI word sweep.
    - `gemini/2_stylistic_narrative_enhancement.json`: Consolidates overwritten language reduction, sensory enhancement, and subtlety creation.
    - `gemini/3_advanced_structural_statistical_humanization.json`: Integrates strategic imperfections, structural construction elimination, AI pattern detection, and statistical analysis.
    - `gemini/4_dialogue_refinement.json`: Combines dialogue enhancement and character-specific dialogue pass.
- **Gemini n8n workflow:** `gemini/n8n_gemini_workflow.json` created to orchestrate the new 4-stage pipeline.
- **Gemini workflow documentation:** `gemini/README.md` provides a comprehensive guide to the Gemini-optimized approach, usage instructions, and n8n integration.
- **Main README update:** The root `README.md` has been updated with a new section linking to the Gemini workflow documentation.
