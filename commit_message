feat: Add OpenRouter n8n workflow for Gemini and update docs

This commit introduces a new n8n workflow that allows users to access Gemini models via OpenRouter, providing an alternative for integration and model access.

Key changes include:
- **New n8n workflow:** `gemini/n8n_gemini_openrouter_workflow.json` has been created, adapting the existing Gemini workflow to use OpenRouter's API endpoint.
- **Updated Gemini documentation:** The `gemini/README.md` file has been updated to include a new section detailing the OpenRouter integration, its setup instructions, and model usage.
