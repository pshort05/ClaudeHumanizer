# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

ClaudeHumanizer is a repository for Claude prompts designed to help humanize AI-written text. Currently, this is a minimal repository with only basic project setup files.

## Repository Structure

This repository currently contains:
- `README.md` - Basic project description
- `.gitignore` - Standard Python gitignore template

## Development Setup

Since this repository does not yet contain actual code or dependencies, no specific setup commands are currently required. The Python gitignore suggests this will eventually be a Python-based project.

## Future Development Notes

Based on the project name and description, this repository is intended to contain prompts and potentially tooling for humanizing AI-generated text. When code is added:

- Follow Python conventions if implementing tooling
- Consider organizing prompts in a clear directory structure
- Add appropriate dependencies and setup files (requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, etc.) when needed

## Current State

This repository is in initial setup phase with no executable code or specific development workflows established yet.
