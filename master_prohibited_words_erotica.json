  "description": "Genre-specific prohibited patterns for erotica fiction. Use this list ONLY when processing explicit sexual content where specificity and directness are essential. These patterns address AI defaults in erotica: euphemism overload, generic sensation language, and emotional distance in sex scenes.",
  "usage_note": "This list is OPTIONAL - include only when the author has explicitly indicated content is erotica and wants genre-specific pattern detection.",
  "when_to_use": [
    "Author is writing erotica or explicit sexual content",
    "Author requests genre-specific AI pattern detection",
    "Authentic detail about sexual sensation is a priority",
    "Author wants to avoid euphemisms and generic sensation language"
  ],
  "when_to_skip": [
    "Fade-to-black romance scenes",
    "Literary fiction using euphemism intentionally",
    "Author has not indicated content is erotica",
    "Character-specific voice that uses euphemism naturally"

Replace with specific anatomical language, direct action description showing what's actually happening, and authentic character perspective on sensation and power."
