I slipped into the HeartLink office at 1:47 PM, which was almost early for me considering last night’s disaster with some guy who spent forty minutes explaining cryptocurrency. I spent that time mentally rewriting his dating profile to include “conversational terrorist” as a hobby.
“Another victorious evening in the trenches?” Sam’s voice drifted over the cubicle wall before his head appeared, black notebook ready like he was documenting my romantic failures for posterity.
I dropped my bag on my desk hard enough to make my monitor wobble. “Great.”
“That bad?”
“TequilaTuesday22 showed up drunk. At 6 PM. On a Sunday.”
Sam’s pen moved across paper. “That’s… interesting.”
“Stop writing that down.”
“I’m not.” More scratching. “Did you report him?”
I yanked my laptop open. The HeartLink logo mocked me with its interconnected hearts. My personal manhwa tab was still open from Friday, the latest webisode of “My Boss is a Demon” taunting me with fictional men who at least had the decency to be interesting when they were terrible. I minimized it fast, tugging my blazer straight.
The dating report dashboard loaded, revealing my recent matches. TequilaTuesday22’s profile photo showed him holding a fish, because nothing attracted women like dead marine life. FitnessFirst had six gym selfies and a bio that said “CrossFit is life 💪” which should have been my first warning sign.
CrossFit isn’t life, Brad. Lying about your height is.
I scrolled through tonight’s lineup, stomach churning. CoolNYCBro98 at 7 PM at some bar in Murray Hill. His messages consisted of “hey” and “u up?” but the algorithm insisted we were an 87% match. Tomorrow was worse: three back-to-back coffee dates because I’d lost a bet with the universe.
“At least you get free dinners,” Sam offered, still hovering.
“I paid for my own drinks after TequilaTuesday tried to order me something called a ‘Skinny Bitch.’”
“That’s… wow.”
“Yeah, my father had a sense of humor too,” I muttered, typing up my report. Subject showed signs of alcohol dependency and fragile masculinity. Recommend algorithm adjustments to filter for basic human decency.
“Yo, dating girl! My office now!”
I froze, my fingers stopping over my keyboard. Mr. Henderson stood in his doorway, tie askew, looking like a man who thought “dating girl” was acceptable professional address.
Sam winced. “Good luck.”
I stood, tugged my blazer straight again, and walked into Henderson’s office with my jaw clenched.
“What?” The word came out sharp.
Henderson blinked, thrown off his game for a second. “What… what do you mean what?”
“You called me ‘dating girl.’ In front of everyone. Again. So what do you want?”
“I… that’s not…” He shuffled papers on his desk. “Sit down, Kim. I have an assignment for you.”
I sat, mostly because standing gave him a height advantage and I was tired of looking up at mediocre men.
“There’s a data security summit this week at the Marriott Marquis,” he said, sliding a conference badge across his desk. “Three days of presentations on encryption, privacy protocols, the whole nine yards.”
My heart skipped a beat. Real security work! The kind I’d trained for, the kind that didn’t involve analyzing why men thought mirror selfies were acceptable in 2023.
“I want you to attend,” Henderson continued, “to understand the male tech mindset better.”
The words hit like a brick. “I’m sorry, what?”
“These security guys, they’re your target demographic, right? Similar to our users but more… technical. Go to the conference, interview some of them, figure out what makes them tick.” He leaned back in his chair, pleased with himself. “Then come back with a report on how to improve our alorithm.”
“Algorithm.”
“That’s what I said.”
I stared at him. This man made three times my salary and couldn’t pronounce the basic terminology of our industry. “You want me to go to a security conference… to research dating?”
“Bingo! These guys struggle with relationships, right? All that time with computers. You’ll get great perspective.”
These guys. Like every man in tech was some basement-dwelling stereotype. Like I wasn’t sitting right here with a degree in Computer Science and three cybersecurity certifications gathering dust.
“Mr. Henderson,” I tried again, voice steady, “I could contribute security ideas. Our platform has vulnerabilities that…”
“That’s what we pay the IT department for.” He waved dismissively. “Focus on what you’re good at, Kim. The dating stuff.”
What I’m good at. Not my encryption knowledge or my ability to spot security flaws. Dating stuff. Because I was a woman who went on dates, and that was the only lens through which Henderson could see me.
“Interview at least ten guys,” he continued, turning back to his computer screen. “Get their dating histories, their app preferences, what they look for in women. The usual.”
I took the conference badge. Its weight was nothing in my hand but felt like a stone in my stomach. Three days of security presentations I’d understand, surrounded by people doing the work I wanted to do, and I’d be there taking notes on their romantic failures.
“Will that be all?” I managed to keep my voice steady.
“That’s it. Good talk, Kim.”
I left his office before I could say something that would get me fired and blacklisted from every tech company in Manhattan. Not that it would be a huge loss, except I needed this job. The pay was good, and even though Henderson’s toxic management style, having HeartLink on my resume opened doors. Even if those doors led to more rooms where men asked me about dating instead of coding.
Back at my desk, I stared at the conference badge. Data Security Summit. My fingers traced the letters. Three days of listening to tech bros explain cybersecurity to each other, most of them mansplaining concepts I could run circles around.
But still. It was closer to real security work than anything I’d done in the six months since Henderson had pigeonholed me into the dating research position. Maybe I could sneak into some technical sessions. Maybe I could network with people who’d see me as more than a girl who went on bad dates for a living.
Sam’s head appeared again. “That bad?”
“He wants me to go to a security conference to study the mating habits of software engineers.”
“Jesus.”
“Yeah.” I pulled up the conference schedule on my laptop, my heart doing something complicated in my chest. Presentations on ethical hacking, zero-day exploits, advanced encryption protocols. This was my world, or it should have been.
“You could quit,” Sam said quietly.
“And do what? Every other company would stick me in the same box. At least here the box pays well.”
My phone lit up. CoolNYCBro98: cant wait 2 meet u tonight beautiful
I stared at the message, then at the conference badge, then at my computer screen where FitnessFirst’s profile still glowed.
Why do men lie about CrossFit? I typed into my report. Same reason they lie about everything else: because they think we’re too stupid to notice.
Henderson wanted me to understand the male tech mindset? Fine. But he might not like what I found.
I grabbed the badge and headed for the subway, dreading whatever disaster awaited me tonight with CoolNYCBro98. But after that, I had a conference to attend.
Three days of tech bros explaining my own field to me.
This should be fun.
