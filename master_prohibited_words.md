> ### Note on Weak Language Patterns
>
> Weak language patterns (puff words, empty calorie words, inflation words, weasel words, hedge words, filter phrases, cliches, formal hedging, redundant phrases, conversational idioms, overused transitions, and robotic qualifiers) are handled exclusively by Phase 7.
>
> **Reference:** See `7_weak_language_cleanup.json` for complete list of weak language patterns and examples.
>
> **Reason for Exclusion:** These patterns are only used by Phase 7 and are already embedded in that phase's prompt with full examples and guidance.

## Contextual Patterns

*   **armor_metaphors:**
    *   `wore * like armor`
    *   `* armor against *`
    *   `emotional armor`
    *   `armor of *`
*   **dancing_metaphors:**
    *   `fingers danced *`
    *   `* danced over *`
    *   `light danced *`
    *   `shadows danced *`
*   **mask_metaphors:**
    *   `* like a mask`
    *   `* was a mask`
    *   `mask of *`
    *   `behind a mask of *`

## Dialogue Pause Pattern Rules

**Description:** AI over-describes pauses in dialogue with flowery metaphors. Replace with simple, direct alternatives.

**Detection Rule:** Any metaphorical or elaborate description of a pause, silence, or gap in conversation between characters, OR any description that suggests unspoken tension/meaning hanging in the air.

**Common AI Patterns:**
*   `weight of * words`
*   `words hung *`
*   `words settled *`
*   `words lingered *`
*   `words echoed *`
*   `words filled the *`
*   `silence stretched *`
*   `silence hung *`
*   `silence settled *`
*   `comfortable silence`
*   `quiet hung *`
*   `pause hung *`
*   `pause stretched *`
*   `pause filled *`
*   `beat of silence`
*   `moment hung *`
*   `air between them *`
*   `air between us *`
*   `space between them *`
*   `gap filled with *`
*   `fell between *`
*   `question * in the air *`
*   `question hung *`
*   `loaded with implications`
*   `loaded with possibilities`
*   `loaded with possibility`
*   `thought hits me *`
*   `thought hit *`

**Allowed Replacements Only:**
*   `Silence.`
*   `Awkward silence.`
*   `A pause.`
*   `Neither spoke.`
*   `No one said anything.`
*   `[Remove the description entirely and just continue with the next dialogue or action]`

**Replacement Strategy:**
*   **Preferred:** Remove the pause description entirely - let the dialogue speak for itself.
*   **Simple Alternative:** Use 'Silence.' or 'A pause.' only when the pause is essential to the scene.
*   **Awkward Alternative:** Use 'Awkward silence.' only when the pause is specifically uncomfortable.
*   **Never Use:** Any metaphorical or elaborate descriptions of silence, pauses, or conversational gaps.

**Examples:**

**Bad AI Writing:**
*   `The weight of his words hung in the air between them.`
*   `Her words settled over the room like a heavy blanket.`
*   `Silence stretched between them, taut and uncomfortable.`
*   `The pause filled the space with unspoken tension.`
*   `The question hung in the air between us.`
*   `Her silence was loaded with implications.`
*   `Comfortable silence fell between them.`
*   `The thought hit me harder than it should.`

**Good Human Writing:**
*   `Silence.`
*   `Neither spoke.`
*   `[No pause description - just continue to next dialogue]`
*   `Awkward silence.`
*   `[Simply move to next action or dialogue without describing the pause]`

**Pattern Matching Instruction:** Identify ANY description of a conversational pause, silence, unspoken tension, or 'things hanging in the air' that uses metaphor, personification, or elaborate language. This includes: pauses described with physical verbs (hung, stretched, settled, filled), silences given qualities (comfortable, loaded, heavy), questions or thoughts described as lingering, and anything suggesting meaning/tension floating between characters. Replace with simple alternatives or remove entirely.

## Light Description Pattern Rules

**Description:** AI over-describes light with elaborate filtering/casting/reflecting metaphors. Replace with simple, direct alternatives.

**Detection Rule:** Any description of light that uses verbs like 'filtering', 'casting', 'streaming', 'slanting', or elaborate metaphors for illumination.

**Common AI Patterns:**
*   `light filtered *`
*   `light filtering *`
*   `* filtering through *`
*   `* filtered through *`
*   `sunlight filtering *`
*   `sunlight streaming *`
*   `sunlight slanted *`
*   `sun filtered *`
*   `sun painted *`
*   `moonlight filtering *`
*   `moonlight reflecting *`
*   `morning light streams *`
*   `casting * shadows`
*   `cast * shadows`
*   `casting everything in gold`
*   `casting golden patterns`
*   `casting shadows`
*   `light slanted through *`
*   `afternoon light casts *`

**Allowed Replacements Only:**
*   `in the moonlight`
*   `in the sunlight`
*   `afternoon sun`
*   `morning sun`
*   `evening light`
*   `dim light`
*   `bright light`
*   `in the shadows`
*   `[Remove the light description entirely if not essential]`

**Replacement Strategy:**
*   **Preferred:** Use simple prepositional phrases: 'in the [time] [light source]' (e.g., 'in the afternoon sun', 'in the moonlight').
*   **Simple Alternative:** Use direct noun phrases: 'afternoon sun', 'morning light', 'dim room'.
*   **Never Use:** Verbs like filtering, streaming, slanting, casting, painting with light; elaborate metaphors for illumination.

**Examples:**

**Bad AI Writing:**
*   `Sunlight filtered through the dusty window.`
*   `The afternoon light cast everything in gold.`
*   `Moonlight filtering through the curtains illuminated her face.`
*   `Light slanted through the blinds, casting golden patterns on the floor.`
*   `Morning light streamed through the window.`
*   `The sun painted the room in warm hues.`

**Good Human Writing:**
*   `In the afternoon sun`
*   `The dusty window`
*   `In the moonlight`
*   `Morning sun`
*   `The bright room`
*   `[Remove light description - just describe the scene directly]`

**Pattern Matching Instruction:** Identify ANY description of light/sunlight/moonlight that uses active verbs (filtering, streaming, slanting, casting, painting) or elaborate metaphors. Replace with simple prepositional phrases like 'in the [light source]' or direct nouns like '[time] sun/light'. Prefer removal if the light description doesn't add essential information.

## Finger/Hand Action Pattern Rules

**Description:** AI over-describes finger/hand movements with elaborate verbs instead of simply naming the action. Replace with direct action verbs.

**Detection Rule:** Any description of fingers/hands doing an action that focuses on the finger movement rather than the action itself (especially typing, writing, touching).

**Common AI Patterns:**
*   `fingers * moving`
*   `fingers are moving`
*   `fingers moved *`
*   `fingers dancing *`
*   `fingers danced *`
*   `fingers hovering *`
*   `fingers hovered *`
*   `fingers hung *`
*   `fingers traced *`
*   `fingers flew *`
*   `fingers drummed *`
*   `fingers glided *`
*   `hands dancing *`
*   `hands danced *`
*   `hands hovering *`
*   `hands flew *`
*   `running * fingers *`
*   `running his fingers *`
*   `running her fingers *`
*   `my finger hovers *`
*   `finger hovers over *`

**Allowed Replacements Only:**
*   `typing`
*   `stopped typing`
*   `typed`
*   `wrote`
*   `writing`
*   `touched`
*   `traced`
*   `tapped`
*   `clicked`
*   `pressed`
*   `[Use the actual action verb directly without describing finger movement]`

**Replacement Strategy:**
*   **Preferred:** Use the direct action verb: 'typing' instead of 'fingers moving across the keyboard'.
*   **Simple Alternative:** Name the completed action: 'typed', 'wrote', 'touched', 'traced'.
*   **Never Use:** Elaborate descriptions of finger/hand movements (dancing, hovering, flying, gliding, drumming). Just name the action being performed.
*   **Context Awareness:** If 'traced' is used for actual tracing (e.g., tracing a scar, tracing a map), keep it. Only replace when it's over-describing a simple action.

**Examples:**

**Bad AI Writing:**
*   `My fingers danced across the keyboard.`
*   `Her fingers hovered over the keys.`
*   `His fingers flew over the laptop.`
*   `Fingers moving, I typed out a response.`
*   `I ran my fingers along the edge of the table.`
*   `My finger hovers over the send button.`

**Good Human Writing:**
*   `I typed.`
*   `She paused.`
*   `He typed fast.`
*   `I typed a response.`
*   `I touched the table edge.`
*   `I hesitated.`
*   `My finger over the send button.`

**Pattern Matching Instruction:** Identify ANY description that focuses on finger/hand movement instead of the actual action being performed. Ask: 'What is the person actually DOING?' Replace with the direct action verb (typing, writing, touching, clicking) without elaborating on finger movements. If the finger/hand description is the only content, replace with the action verb or remove entirely.

## Replacement Strategy

*   **Primary Approach:** Replace with simpler, more natural alternatives.
*   **Secondary Approach:** Remove entirely if the word adds no essential meaning.
*   **Preservation Rule:** Maintain meaning while improving authenticity.
*   **Consistency Rule:** Once a term is replaced, ensure it doesn't reappear in later processing stages.
