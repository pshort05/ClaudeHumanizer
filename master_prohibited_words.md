## Note on Weak Language Patterns

**Description:** Weak language patterns (puff words, empty calorie words, inflation words, weasel words, hedge words, filter phrases, cliches, formal hedging, redundant phrases, conversational idioms, overused transitions, and robotic qualifiers) are handled exclusively by Phase 7.

**Reference:** See `7_weak_language_cleanup.json` for complete list of weak language patterns and examples.

**Reason for Exclusion:** These patterns are only used by Phase 7 and are already embedded in that phase's prompt with full examples and guidance.

## Pattern-Based Rules

### Punctuation Pattern Rules

**Description:** AI tends to overuse em dashes and en dashes for dramatic pauses or appositives. Replace with simpler punctuation.

**Detection Rule:** Any use of em dashes (—) or en dashes (–) in the text

**Prohibited Punctuation:**
- Em dash (—)
- En dash (–)

**Replacement Strategy:**
- **Do:** Replace em/en dashes with commas when setting off appositives or parenthetical information
- **Avoid:** Em dashes (—) or en dashes (–) in any context. These are AI-associated punctuation marks.
- **Alternatives:**
  - Break into two separate sentences using a period

**Note:** Em and en dashes are rarely used in natural human writing. When they appear, they're usually a sign of AI-generated text trying to create dramatic pauses or connections.

**Examples:**
- **Bad:** The proposal—despite its flaws—was accepted.
- **Good:** The proposal, despite its flaws, was accepted.

**Replacements:**
- Use commas for appositives and parenthetical phrases
- Use periods to break into separate sentences
- Use colons for introducing lists or explanations

**Detect:** Identify ALL em dashes (—) and en dashes (–) in the text. Replace with commas for appositives/parentheticals, periods for sentence breaks, or restructure to eliminate the dash entirely. Never preserve em or en dashes in the output.

---

### Contextual Patterns

**Armor Metaphors:**
- wore * like armor
- * armor against *
- emotional armor
- armor of *

**Dancing Metaphors:**
- fingers danced *
- * danced over *
- light danced *
- shadows danced *

**Mask Metaphors:**
- * like a mask
- * was a mask
- mask of *
- behind a mask of *

---

### Dialogue Pause Pattern Rules

**Description:** AI over-describes pauses in dialogue with flowery metaphors. Replace with simple, direct alternatives.

**Detection Rule:** Any metaphorical or elaborate description of a pause, silence, or gap in conversation between characters, OR any description that suggests unspoken tension/meaning hanging in the air

**Replacement Strategy:**
- **Do:** Remove the pause description entirely - let the dialogue speak for itself
- **Avoid:** Any metaphorical or elaborate descriptions of silence, pauses, or conversational gaps
- **Alternatives:**
  - Use 'Silence.' or 'A pause.' only when the pause is essential to the scene
  - Use 'Awkward silence.' only when the pause is specifically uncomfortable

**Examples:**
- **Bad:** The weight of his words hung in the air between them.
- **Good:** Silence.

**Patterns:**
- weight of * words
- words hung *
- words settled *
- words lingered *
- words echoed *
- words filled the *
- silence stretched *
- silence hung *
- silence settled *
- comfortable silence
- quiet hung *
- pause hung *
- pause stretched *
- pause filled *
- beat of silence
- moment hung *
- air between them *
- air between us *

**Replacements:**
- Silence.
- Awkward silence.
- A pause.

**Detect:** Identify ANY description of a conversational pause, silence, unspoken tension, or 'things hanging in the air' that uses metaphor, personification, or elaborate language. This includes: pauses described with physical verbs (hung, stretched, settled, filled), silences given qualities (comfortable, loaded, heavy), questions or thoughts described as lingering, and anything suggesting meaning/tension floating between characters. Replace with simple alternatives or remove entirely.

---

### Light Description Pattern Rules

**Description:** AI over-describes light with elaborate filtering/casting/reflecting metaphors. Replace with simple, direct alternatives.

**Detection Rule:** Any description of light that uses verbs like 'filtering', 'casting', 'streaming', 'slanting', or elaborate metaphors for illumination

**Replacement Strategy:**
- **Do:** Use simple prepositional phrases: 'in the [time] [light source]' (e.g., 'in the afternoon sun', 'in the moonlight')
- **Avoid:** Verbs like filtering, streaming, slanting, casting, painting with light; elaborate metaphors for illumination
- **Alternatives:**
  - Use direct noun phrases: 'afternoon sun', 'morning light', 'dim room'

**Examples:**
- **Bad:** Sunlight filtered through the dusty window.
- **Good:** In the afternoon sun

**Patterns:**
- light filtered *
- light filtering *
- * filtering through *
- * filtered through *
- sunlight filtering *
- sunlight streaming *
- sunlight slanted *
- sun filtered *
- sun painted *
- moonlight filtering *
- moonlight reflecting *
- morning light streams *
- casting * shadows
- cast * shadows
- casting everything in gold
- casting golden patterns
- casting shadows
- light slanted through *
- afternoon light casts *

**Replacements:**
- in the moonlight
- in the sunlight
- afternoon sun

**Detect:** Identify ANY description of light/sunlight/moonlight that uses active verbs (filtering, streaming, slanting, casting, painting) or elaborate metaphors. Replace with simple prepositional phrases like 'in the [light source]' or direct nouns like '[time] sun/light'. Prefer removal if the light description doesn't add essential information.

---

### Finger/Hand Action Pattern Rules

**Description:** AI over-describes finger/hand movements with elaborate verbs instead of simply naming the action. Replace with direct action verbs.

**Detection Rule:** Any description of fingers/hands doing an action that focuses on the finger movement rather than the action itself (especially typing, writing, touching)

**Replacement Strategy:**
- **Do:** Use the direct action verb: 'typing' instead of 'fingers moving across the keyboard'
- **Avoid:** Elaborate descriptions of finger/hand movements (dancing, hovering, flying, gliding, drumming). Just name the action being performed.
- **Alternatives:**
  - Name the completed action: 'typed', 'wrote', 'touched', 'traced'

**Note:** If 'traced' is used for actual tracing (e.g., tracing a scar, tracing a map), keep it. Only replace when it's over-describing a simple action.

**Examples:**
- **Bad:** My fingers danced across the keyboard.
- **Good:** I typed.

**Patterns:**
- fingers * moving
- fingers are moving
- fingers moved *
- fingers dancing *
- fingers danced *
- fingers hovering *
- fingers hovered *
- fingers hung *
- fingers traced *
- fingers flew *
- fingers drummed *
- fingers glided *
- hands dancing *

**Replacements:**
- typing
- stopped typing
- typed

**Detect:** Identify ANY description that focuses on finger/hand movement instead of the actual action being performed. Ask: 'What is the person actually DOING?' Replace with the direct action verb (typing, writing, touching, clicking) without elaborating on finger movements. If the finger/hand description is the only content, replace with the action verb or remove entirely.

---

### Meta-Analytical Pattern Rules

**Description:** AI generates academic rhetorical analysis language that sounds formulaic and detached. Replace with direct, active descriptions.

**Detection Rule:** Any meta-analytical description of communication techniques, rhetorical devices, or persuasive strategies using academic terminology

**Replacement Strategy:**
- **Do:** Remove the meta-analytical framing and use only the direct action verb
- **Avoid:** Academic rhetorical terminology (ethos, pathos, logos, appeal, builds credibility, establishes authority). Just show the action directly.
- **Alternatives:**
  - Replace 'X by doing Y' with just 'does Y'

**Note:** This pattern is extremely common in rhetorical analysis essays and AI-generated content analysis. Always simplify to direct action.

**Examples:**
- **Bad:** He builds trust by showing confidence in the technology.
- **Good:** He shows confidence in the technology.

**Patterns:**
- builds/build [trust/credibility/ethos/rapport] by [verb]ing
- [He/She/They] uses/use [logic/reason/emotion/pathos/ethos/logos] by [verb]ing
- [possessive] [emotional/logical/rational] appeal comes through [verb]ing
- appeals to [pathos/logos/ethos/emotion/logic/reason] by [verb]ing
- establishes [trust/credibility/authority] through [verb]ing
- creates [connection/rapport/bond] by [verb]ing
- demonstrates [skill/expertise/knowledge] through [verb]ing
- conveys [meaning/message/idea] through [verb]ing
- achieves [effect/impact/result] by [verb]ing

**Replacements:**
- Use direct, active verbs showing the action
- Replace 'builds trust by showing confidence' with 'shows confidence'
- Replace 'uses logic by explaining' with 'explains' or 'breaks down'

**Detect:** Identify ANY meta-analytical rhetorical analysis language that describes communication techniques using academic frameworks. Common patterns: 'builds X by Y-ing', 'uses X by Y-ing', 'appeal comes through Y-ing', 'establishes X through Y-ing'. Always replace with the direct action verb only - remove all meta-analytical framing.

---

### False Contrast Rhetorical Pattern Rules

**Description:** AI overuses the 'It's not X, it's Y' rhetorical device to create artificial tension and contrast.

**Detection Rule:** Any use of the 'It's not [about] X, it's [about] Y' construction or its variants that creates false dichotomies or forced contrasts

**Why This Is Problematic:**
- **Rhetoric Over Reasoning:** The construction prioritizes performative contrast over clear explanation of how X and Y actually relate
- **Forced Tension:** Creates artificial tension-release cycles that manipulate rather than inform
- **Frequency Spam:** Appears with such uniformity in AI content that it becomes a detectable signature
- **False Dichotomy:** Often presents ideas as opposing when they're actually complementary or unrelated
- **Cadence Signal:** The predictable rhythm signals AI-assisted content, especially in video essays and long-form writing

**Replacement Strategy:**
- **Do:** Remove the false contrast and state the main point (Y) directly
- **Avoid:** The 'It's not X, it's Y' construction in any of its variants. This is a primary AI signature pattern.
- **Alternatives:**
  - Replace with 'X involves Y' or 'X means Y' to show relationship without opposition

**Note:** This pattern is especially prevalent in: marketing copy, video essay scripts, self-help content, business writing, and motivational content. When found, it's a strong AI detection signal.

**Examples:**
- **Bad:** It's not about managing symptoms. It's about rewriting the narrative of the self.
- **Good:** We rewrite the narrative of the self.

**Patterns:**
- It's not about X. It's about Y.
- It's not X. It's Y.
- This isn't just X. It's Y.
- This isn't about X. It's about Y.
- It's not just about X. It's about Y.
- This is not X. This is Y.
- We're not X. We're Y.
- I'm not X. I'm Y.
- It isn't X. It's Y.
- The point isn't X. It's Y.
- The goal isn't X. It's Y.

**Replacements:**
- Use direct exposition: State what something IS without contrasting what it ISN'T
- Use explicit causality: Explain the relationship between concepts directly
- Use assisted inferences: Guide readers to conclusions without false contrast

**Detect:** Identify ANY construction that follows the 'It's not X, it's Y' pattern or its variants. This includes negating one concept to elevate another in a way that creates false opposition. Common markers: 'It's not [about/just/just about]', 'This isn't [just/about]', 'We're not', followed by contrasting statement with 'It's', 'This is', 'We're'. Replace with direct statements that clarify relationships without performative contrast.

### Physical Tells Patterns

**Description:** AI identifies emotions through physical reactions, but uses the same limited set of tells repeatedly.

**Detection Rule:** Any physical reaction described with verbs like tightening, clenching, trembling, catching breath, etc. in emotional context. Look for body parts (hands, breath, jaw, throat, chest, stomach) combined with mechanical emotion-indicators.

**Replacement Strategy:**
- **Do:** Remove the description entirely and let the character's action speak. If emotion must be shown, use concrete action with consequence, not labeled feeling.
- **Avoid:** Don't describe the mechanical emotion-tell. These patterns are recognizable as AI defaults.
- **Alternatives:**
  - Describe what the character does because of the emotion: 'She gripped her coffee cup. The liquid sloshed over the rim.' instead of 'Her hands trembled.'
  - Show the interruption in action/speech: 'He stopped mid-sentence' instead of 'His breath caught.'

**Examples:**
- **Bad:** Her hands trembled, betraying her anxiety.
- **Good:** She gripped her coffee cup. The liquid sloshed over the rim.

**Patterns:**
- hands trembl*
- hands shak*
- hands clench*
- hands flex*
- hands whiten*
- hands curl*
- hands ball*
- hands uncurl*
- breath catch*
- breath hitch*
- breath stall*
- breath held
- breath releas*
- breath short
- breath quick
- breath shallow
- breath ragged
- jaw tighten*
- jaw clench*
- jaw tense*
- jaw work*
- jaw loosen*

**Replacements:**
- [Delete entirely - let action speak for itself]
- She gripped the edge of the table
- He held his breath

**Detect:** Identify ANY physical reaction to emotion that uses mechanical body-part verbs (trembling, clenching, tightening, constricting, catching, etc.). These are AI defaults. Replace by either removing entirely or converting to specific character action with concrete detail.

---

### Emotion Intensifier Bans

**Description:** AI uses paper-thin descriptors that 'sound profound but mean nothing.

**Detection Rule:** Texture/fragility language modifying emotion or control-related nouns (patience, control, composure, restraint). Look for: gossamer, threadbare, frayed, worn thin, stretched to breaking, razor-thin, paper-thin.

**Replacement Strategy:**
- **Do:** Delete the intensifier completely. Often the core noun alone is sufficient.
- **Avoid:** These texture intensifiers (paper-thin, gossamer, threadbare, etc.) with emotional/control words. They're AI signature patterns.
- **Alternatives:**
  - If intensity must be conveyed, show it through action/consequence, not through fragility language.

**Examples:**
- **Bad:** His control was paper-thin, stretched to breaking.
- **Good:** He hadn't slept. His hands shook slightly.

**Patterns:**
- visceral
- primal
- paper-thin control
- paper-thin patience
- paper-thin composure
- gossamer-thin
- razor-thin
- threadbare
- frayed edges
- worn thin
- worn down
- stretched to breaking
- stretched taut
- stretched thin

**Replacements:**
- [Delete the intensifier entirely]
- Show specific evidence: 'He hadn't slept. His hands shook slightly.'
- Remove modifier and keep core: 'His control was slipping' instead of 'His control was paper-thin'

**Detect:** Identify intensifiers (paper-thin, threadbare, gossamer, frayed, worn thin, stretched to breaking) paired with emotion/control words. Delete or replace with concrete action showing the emotional state.

---

### Transition Beat Placeholders

**Description:** Mechanical delay tactics that interrupt action and momentum. These are pure AI defaults designed to add false suspense without substance.

**Detection Rule:** Temporal/pause phrases between action beats, especially those designed to delay revelation: 'for a long moment', 'for a beat', 'for a suspended moment', 'after a moment'. Also patterns like 'when [character] speaks, voice is [adjective]'.

**Replacement Strategy:**
- **Do:** Delete entirely. Continue directly to the next action or dialogue.
- **Avoid:** Elaborate descriptions of delays, suspenseful pauses, or emotional beats between actions.
- **Alternatives:**
  - Use one-word beat markers only if essential: 'Silence.' or 'A pause.' - but usually delete even these.

**Examples:**
- **Bad:** For a long moment, neither of them spoke. The silence that followed was heavy with implication.
- **Good:** Silence. She waited for him to continue.

**Patterns:**
- for a long moment
- for a beat
- for a suspended moment
- for a heartbeat
- after a moment
- a pause then
- a pause before

- when he speaks *
- when she speaks *
- when they speak *

- the pause that follows is *
- the moment that follows is *

**Replacements:**
- [Delete entirely and continue to next beat]
- Silence.
- A pause.

**Detect:** Identify temporal delay phrases and suspension beats between actions. Delete them entirely unless there's specific story reason for the delay. Most are mechanical AI padding.

---

### Gaze Descriptors

**Description:** These create the appearance of depth and communication without actual substance.

**Detection Rule:** Any adjective describing eyes/gaze that implies knowledge, evaluation, or hidden depths without showing evidence: assessing, appraising, knowing, penetrating, unreadable, inscrutable, cataloguing, measuring, shuttered, guarded, too knowing, seeing too much.

**Replacement Strategy:**
- **Do:** Delete and show what the look actually communicates through dialogue or action. 'His gaze was unreadable' tells. 'He stared at her without expression' shows. Even better: 'He stared at her. "You're lying."'
- **Avoid:** Abstract gaze descriptors implying knowledge/evaluation/hidden depths. Let actions and words do the communication.
- **Alternatives:**
  - Use specific action: 'His eyes narrowed' (shows skepticism), 'She looked away' (shows shame or evasion), 'He didn't blink' (shows intensity).

**Examples:**
- **Bad:** His gaze was too knowing, cataloguing every hesitation.
- **Good:** His gaze didn't move from her face. 'You're lying.'

**Patterns:**
- assessing gaze
- assessing look
- appraising gaze
- appraising look
- cataloguing *
- cataloging *

### Temperature Emotion Bans

**Description:** Temperature is 'the most generic descriptor for emotion, narrowing emotional spectrum to two options: hot (angry/passionate) and cold (distant/afraid).

**Detection Rule:** Temperature metaphors (hot, cold, warm, ice, fire, frozen, heat, etc.) applied to describe emotional state, fear, passion, or emotional shifts. Look for: 'cold dread', 'heat between them', 'frozen in place', 'fire licked up spine'.

**Replacement Strategy:**
- **Do:** Delete entirely. Temperature is a lie - emotions don't have temperature.
- **Avoid:** Temperature metaphors for emotion. Never.
- **Alternatives:**
  - Show specific physical symptom: 'His hands shook' instead of 'Cold fear filled him.'
  - Show consequence or behavioral change: 'She couldn't focus. Couldn't think.' instead of 'Warmth spread through her.'

**Note:** This pattern is especially prevalent in romance and erotica, where it's used to describe physical attraction. Still avoid it.

**Examples:**
- **Bad:** Cold dread settled in her stomach as she read the letter.
- **Good:** She read the letter. Read it again. Her hands wouldn't stop shaking.

**Patterns:**
- cold dread
- cold fear

---

### Breaking/Cracking Metaphors

**Description:** Every emotional shift becomes 'something broke' or 'something cracked.

**Detection Rule:** Structural failure metaphors (breaking, cracking, shattering, fractured, splintered) applied to emotional/psychological states. Look for: 'something broke', 'something cracked', 'splintered', 'fractured', 'fault lines', 'cracks in foundation'.

**Replacement Strategy:**
- **Do:** Delete entirely. Replace with specific consequence or behavioral change.
- **Avoid:** Structural damage metaphors for emotion.
- **Alternatives:**
  - Show what the character does: 'She started crying' instead of 'Something inside her broke.'
  - Show the specific effect: 'His conviction wavered' instead of 'Cracks appeared in his foundation.'

**Examples:**
- **Bad:** Something inside him shattered at her words.
- **Good:** Her words hit him like a punch. He had to sit down.

**Patterns:**
- something broke
- something cracked
- something cracked open

---

### Anchor/Tether Metaphors

**Description:** Turns connection into passivity—something that happens to the character rather than something chosen.

**Detection Rule:** Anchor/tether metaphors where one person becomes essential to another's stability or sanity: 'the only thing keeping', 'tethered to', 'anchored to', 'held in place', 'moored'.

**Replacement Strategy:**
- **Do:** Delete and reframe as active choice/behavioral change. Show what the character does because of the relationship, not what the other person does for them.
- **Avoid:** Anchor/tether metaphors for relationships.
- **Alternatives:**
  - Show consequence of separation, not necessity of anchor: 'When she left, he couldn't focus' instead of 'She was his anchor.'

**Examples:**
- **Bad:** She was the only thing keeping him grounded.
- **Good:** When she left, he couldn't focus. Couldn't sleep. Nothing mattered until she came back.

**Patterns:**
- the only thing keeping * grounded
- the only thing keeping * present
- the only thing keeping * sane
- tethered to *
- the tether *
- anchored to *
- held in place by *

- anchored by *
- kept in place by *

**Replacements:**
- [Delete entirely]
- When she left, he couldn't focus. Nothing mattered until she came back.
- He was different when she was there. Better.

**Detect:** Identify anchor/tether language framing one person as essential infrastructure for another's stability. Replace by showing what the character does/feels because of the relationship, not how they're kept in place.

---

### Edge/Precipice Metaphors

**Description:** Abstract geography substituting for specific psychological state. 'Teetering on the edge' tells when to feel tension; it doesn't create it.

**Detection Rule:** Edge/height/falling language describing emotional or psychological state: 'on the edge', 'precipice', 'barely holding on', 'hanging by a thread', 'teetering', 'one wrong move from'.

**Replacement Strategy:**
- **Do:** Delete entirely. Let the moment stand on its own.
- **Avoid:** Metaphorical ledges, edges, or precipices for emotional state.
- **Alternatives:**
  - Show what happens when the character reaches the edge - concrete action/consequence, not abstract position.

**Detect:** Identify edge/precipice language describing emotional state. Delete and replace with specific action showing what happens at the critical moment, not the metaphorical position before it.

---

### Time/Moment Phrases

**Description:** Evokes camera, not consciousness. 'Time seemed to suspend' tells when to feel tension rather than creating it through character action or thought.

**Detection Rule:** Phrases suggesting time suspension, world-narrowing, or cinematic moments in emotional context: 'time stretched', 'suspended in amber', 'frozen in place', 'the world narrowed to', 'everything else fell away', 'the world held its breath'.

**Replacement Strategy:**
- **Do:** Delete and let the moment stand on its own through character action/dialogue.
- **Avoid:** Time suspension, world-narrowing, or cinematic narration.
- **Alternatives:**
  - Show through character action/dialogue what makes the moment significant, not through narrative framing.

### Permission/Allowance Patterns

**Description:** Labels release rather than showing what changes when restraint drops. 'She allowed herself to cry' tells; 'She cried, shoulders shaking' shows.

**Detection Rule:** Sentences using 'allowed/let/permitted + self + action' structure in emotional context. Look for: 'allowed herself to', 'let himself', 'permitted herself', 'gave herself permission', 'finally let go of'.

**Replacement Strategy:**
- **Do:** Delete the permission framing completely. Show the action directly with sensory detail.
- **Avoid:** Self-permission constructions.
- **Alternatives:**
  - Drop 'allowed herself to' and 'finally permitted herself to' - just use the action: 'She cried' not 'She allowed herself to cry.'

**Examples:**

---

### Realization/Understanding Patterns

**Detection Rule:** Phrases suggesting sudden understanding without showing what was understood or its consequence: 'clicked into place', 'pieces slotted together', 'clarity crashed over', 'truth settled', 'landed with the force of', 'crystallized'.

**Replacement Strategy:**
- **Do:** Delete and show what was understood through character dialogue or action in response.
- **Avoid:** Sudden understanding phrases without showing evidence.
- **Alternatives:**
  - Let character voice the understanding: 'Oh. He's in love with her.' or show action consequence: 'She read the letter twice. She understood.'

**Examples:**

**Detection Rule:** Predator/animal danger vocabulary applied to character descriptions: 'lethal grace', 'predatory', 'coiled to strike', 'dangerous edge', 'barely contained violence', 'quiet menace', 'promise of violence'.

**Replacement Strategy:**
- **Do:** Delete entirely. Show dangerous behavior through what the character does or the reader's character's response to them, not through animal descriptor.
- **Avoid:** Predator/animal descriptors for dangerous humans.
- **Alternatives:**
  - Show through action: 'He moved very still, watching her' instead of 'predatory stillness.'
  - Show through consequence: 'If she ran, he'd catch her' instead of 'lethal grace.'

**Examples:**
- **Bad:** He moved with lethal grace, predatory stillness in every line.

**Replacement Strategy:**
- **Do:** Delete entirely. These add nothing.
- **Avoid:** Generic religious exclamations.
- **Alternatives:**
  - If exclamation is needed, use character-specific ones based on voice/background, not universal defaults.

---

### Ending Cliches

**Description:** Summary posing as closure.

**Detection Rule:** Final summary lines that label emotional impact rather than showing it: 'And for now, that was enough', 'It was a start', 'They would figure it out', 'Everything had changed', 'Nothing would ever be the same'.

**Replacement Strategy:**
- **Do:** Delete entirely. End with action or dialogue that shows change, not summary that tells it.
- **Avoid:** Summary closures or 'that was enough' constructions.
- **Alternatives:**
  - Last image/action/dialogue alone is more powerful than summary. Trust it.

### Description Cliches

**Description:** So common they're invisible. Create no specific visual impression. 'Orbs' for eyes, 'mane' for hair, 'sharp planes' - pure template descriptors.

**Detection Rule:** Formulaic descriptor clichés that appear identically in thousands of stories: 'orbs', 'pools', 'mane', 'column of neck', 'delicate wrists', 'line of jaw', 'broad shoulders', 'lean muscle'.

**Replacement Strategy:**
- **Do:** Delete entire cliché descriptor. Use specific detail unique to character instead.
- **Avoid:** These cliché descriptors that have appeared in thousands of stories identically.
- **Alternatives:**
  - Use simple, direct description: 'dark eyes' instead of 'pools of darkness.' Or skip entirely.
  - Describe specific detail showing character: scar, wrinkle, asymmetry, unique feature not the template.

**Detect:** Identify formulaic descriptor clichés that appear identically across thousands of stories. Delete and replace with specific detail unique to your character - scar, tattoo, mannerism, asymmetry. Trust reader's imagination.

---

### Dialogue Tag Bans

**Description:** AI over-modifies dialogue tags and voice descriptors with adverbs and flowery language. Humans use simple 'said' or show tone through content.

**Detection Rule:** Adverbs modifying 'said' or dialogue: softly, quietly, carefully, flatly, evenly, roughly. Also voice verbs (drops, tightens, breaks, hardens, softens) and qualifiers (deceptively, deliberately, falsely).

**Replacement Strategy:**
- **Do:** Delete adverb entirely. Use plain 'said' or show tone through dialogue content.
- **Avoid:** Adverbs modifying 'said'. These are AI defaults. Show don't tell.
- **Alternatives:**
  - Replace adverbial modifiers with action: 'He paused. "I can't do this."' instead of '"I can't do this," he said softly.'

**Examples:**
- **Bad:** 'I love you,' she whispered softly.
- **Good:** 'I love you,' she said.

**Patterns:**
- softly
- quietly
- carefully
- flatly
- evenly
- roughly

## Replacement Strategy Guidelines

**Primary Approach:** Replace with simpler, more natural alternatives

**Secondary Approach:** Remove entirely if the word adds no essential meaning

**Preservation Rule:** Maintain meaning while improving authenticity

**Consistency Rule:** Once a term is replaced, ensure it doesn't reappear in later processing stages
