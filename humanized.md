I slipped into the HeartLink office at 1:47 PM, which counted as early considering last night’s disaster with a guy who spent forty minutes explaining cryptocurrency. I spent those forty minutes mentally revising his dating profile to include “conversational terrorist” under hobbies.

“Another victorious evening in the trenches?” Sam’s voice floated over the cubicle wall before his head appeared, black notebook poised like he was chronicling my failures for science.

I dropped my bag on my desk hard enough to make my monitor wobble. “Great.”

“That bad?”

“TequilaTuesday22 showed up drunk. At 6 PM. On a Sunday.”

Sam scribbled. “That’s… something.”

“Stop writing that down.”

“I’m not.” More scratching. “Did you report him?”

I yanked my laptop open. HeartLink’s logo—those smug interconnected hearts—glowed back. My manhwa tab was still open from Friday, My Boss is a Demon taunting me with fictional men who at least knew how to be entertaining when terrible. I slammed it shut, tugged my blazer straight.

The dating report dashboard loaded. TequilaTuesday22’s photo: him holding a fish, because apparently dead marine life screams romance. FitnessFirst: six gym selfies and a bio that read CrossFit is life 💪. Warning sign.

CrossFit isn’t life, Brad. Lying about your height is.

I scrolled tonight’s lineup, stomach tight. CoolNYCBro98 at 7 PM in Murray Hill. His messages: “hey” and “u up?” Yet the algorithm swore we were an 87% match. Tomorrow was worse—three coffee dates back-to-back because I’d apparently lost a bet with the universe.

“At least you get free dinners,” Sam offered.

“I paid for my own drinks after TequilaTuesday tried to order me something called a Skinny Bitch.”

“That’s… wow.”

“Yeah, my father had a sense of humor too,” I muttered, typing into my report. Subject: alcohol dependency. Fragile masculinity. Recommend algorithm filter for basic human decency.

“Yo, dating girl! My office now!”

I froze, fingers hovering. Mr. Henderson leaned in his doorway, tie crooked, looking smug about calling me “dating girl” in front of everyone.

Sam winced. “Good luck.”

I tugged my blazer straight again and walked in.

“What?” The word came out sharp.

Henderson blinked, thrown for once. “What do you mean what?”

“You called me ‘dating girl.’ Again. So what do you want?”

“I… that’s not—” He shuffled papers. “Sit down, Kim. I have an assignment.”

I sat, mostly so I didn’t have to look up at him.

“There’s a data security summit this week at the Marriott Marquis. Three days of encryption, privacy protocols—the works.” He slid a conference badge across the desk.

My chest kicked. Real security work. What I’d trained for. Not analyzing why men think bathroom selfies count as personality.

“I want you to attend,” Henderson continued, “to understand the male tech mindset better.”

My heart sank. “I’m sorry, what?”

“These security guys—they’re your target demographic, right? Like our users but more technical. Interview some of them. Figure out what makes them tick.” He leaned back, proud of himself. “Then come back with a report on how to improve our alorithm.”

“Algorithm.”

“That’s what I said.”

This man made triple my salary and couldn’t pronounce the word. “You want me to go to a security conference… for dating research?”

“Bingo. These guys struggle with relationships, right? You’ll get great perspective.”

“These guys.” Basement-dweller stereotype. As if I wasn’t right here—with a CS degree and three cybersecurity certs collecting dust.

“Mr. Henderson,” I tried, voice steady. “I could contribute security insights. Our platform has vulnerabilities—”

“That’s IT’s job.” He waved me off. “Focus on what you’re good at, Kim. The dating stuff.”

Not encryption. Not security. Dating stuff.

“Interview at least ten guys,” he added, turning back to his screen. “Get their dating histories, app preferences, what they look for in women. The usual.”

I took the badge. Light in my hand. Heavy in my gut. Three days of talks I could ace—while I played stenographer for strangers’ dating failures.

“Will that be all?” My voice didn’t crack. Small miracle.

“That’s it. Good talk, Kim.”

I left before I could say something that would blacklist me from every tech job in Manhattan. Not that it would be a huge loss. Except I needed this paycheck. HeartLink on my résumé opened doors. Even if those doors led to more rooms where men asked me about dating instead of coding.

Back at my desk, I stared at the badge. Data Security Summit. My fingers traced the lettering. Three days of tech bros explaining my own field to me. Most of them would probably mansplain concepts I could teach in my sleep.

Still. Closer to real work than anything I’d done in months. Maybe I could sneak into technical sessions. Network. Find someone who saw me as more than “dating girl.”

Sam’s head appeared. “That bad?”

“He wants me to study the mating habits of software engineers.”

“Jesus.”

“Yeah.” I pulled up the conference schedule, heart twitching. Ethical hacking. Zero-day exploits. Advanced encryption. My world—or it should’ve been.

“You could quit,” Sam said quietly.

“And do what? Every company would stick me in the same box. At least here the box pays well.”

My phone lit up. CoolNYCBro98: cant wait 2 meet u tonight beautiful

I stared at the message. Then at the badge. Then at FitnessFirst still glowing on my screen.

Why do men lie about CrossFit? I typed. Same reason they lie about everything else: they think we’re too stupid to notice.

Henderson wanted me to understand the male tech mindset? Fine. But he might not like what I brought back.

I shoved the badge into my bag and headed for the subway, dreading CoolNYCBro98. But after him? A conference.

Three days of tech bros mansplaining my field.
Fun. Can’t wait.
