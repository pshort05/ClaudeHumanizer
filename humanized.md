#Summary of Changes:#
Flat exposition → immediate sensory hooks. I kept your strong opening line but made the surrounding sensory detail more precise so the scene lands faster.

Uniform sentence length → rhythmic variety. I added one-word sentences, fragments, and short bursts to mimic panic and reclaim voice.

Passive/abstract hedge-fund talk → concrete humiliation. Instead of explaining the industry to the reader, I show reputation damage through gestures, phones, and faces.

Emotional distance → interior voice & small asides. Victoria’s internal calculations and shame are made visible — that heightens empathy and tension.

Deep rewrite

"She's with me tonight, Ryan!"

The words cut through the Marron Atrium like someone throwing a wineglass at a chandelier. Heads swivel. Cameras — tiny, polite and lethal — lift. The 110-foot skylight pours warm light across us, as if the museum had rewired itself for the express purpose of humiliating me.

Fantastic. Just fantastic.

Ryan Mitchell goes beet red, tie a perfect match. His hand clamps down on James’s arm so hard James winces. “Get your fucking hands off me,” James snarls, twisting away.

All James wanted was to look good in a tux and say the right thing about the painting. Instead he’s caught in the epicenter of my very public—I’ll-call-it—collapse.

“Ryan, let him go.” I am calm. Inside, I am a spreadsheet sliding across my skull: exits, angles, who I call, who sees. Sixth-Floor Gallery Lobby behind me. Main entrance thirty feet left. Ladies’ room—somewhere, blessedly.

“Don’t tell me what the fuck to do, Victoria.” That possessive burr in his voice — the same one that made me pack boxes six months ago — is back. “We had a deal. The Hendricks account was supposed to be ours.”

“The Hendricks account was mine.” I step forward. Phones are out now. Junior associates, faces lit by screens, smiling the way hyenas smile. “I closed it. I brought in fifteen million. My strategies. My bonus.”

Please not livestream.

James rips free. His sleeve slides up. A sleeve tattoo runs from wrist to elbow: skulls, roses, a naked woman. In our world that’s not ink; it’s a flashing billboard. People glance from the tattoo to me like they’re checking an allergy.

“Two point one million dollars,” Ryan calls, loud and ridiculous, his voice bouncing off the granite like a gavel. “That’s what she pocketed while I did half the groundwork.”

At least the money is already in my account.

Whispers bloom. “Hendricks… Ryan’s client… two million…” The atrium breathes gossip.

“You didn’t do a damn thing on this account,” I snap. My voice travels farther than I planned—perfect acoustics for shame. “You couldn’t even get a lunch. I spent three months building that relationship while you were playing golf.”

Matthew Smith appears at my elbow: disapproval made of cashmere. He looks like a man who’s practiced disappointment and perfected the shape of it. “Ms. Blackwood. Mr. Mitchell.” Quiet. Wintersome. “Perhaps we could continue this somewhere more private.”

Ryan’s not done. “Private? Ask Victoria about her apartment hunting in Tribeca—places she can’t afford with the money that should be—”

“Should be what?” Fury knocks the rest of my manners out of me. “Money I earned. From clients I brought in. Strategies I built.”

Six phones are filming, their screens blinking like altar candles. The minimalist lighting turns them into little searchlights. This is the social-media meat grinder. Matthew’s voice cuts through—controlled, terminal: “Anyone who posts tonight will be looking for new employment tomorrow. Permanently.” Phones vanish. The threats land like mallets.

And still: the damage is already counted on faces—clients, colleagues, competitors. Under a Van Gogh no less. Wearing a dress with a price tag that might finance a month of someone’s life.

I need air. I move like someone who has practiced exits. The ladies’ room is marble and mute and empty. Of course it’s empty; the firm’s women could fit at a poker table.

I stare into the mirror. An hour ago I was celebrating the biggest deal of my career. Now I look like a girl who just failed a very expensive test.

My phone buzzes. James: Got an Uber. You okay? Practical. Discreet. Sweet, in a clumsy way. I text back: I’ll be fine. Don’t wait.

I call my black car. Real leather. No small talk.

I splash water on my wrists—hold the makeup, God—and try to breathe. I have survived hostile takeovers, a market crash, three men trying to steal clients. I can survive an ex with a microphone.

When I step back into the atrium the party has that hush that follows fireworks—awkward, bright, everyone pretending the show is over. People clear a path like drama is contagious.

Time to go.

I walk to 53rd and slide into the waiting town car. “Brooklyn,” I tell the driver. The leather smells like new money and yesterday’s mistakes.

Matthew calls. My stomach drops.

“Victoria.” His voice is small and used up. “We need to discuss tonight’s incident.”

“I can explain—”

“I’m sure you can. For now, take some time. Extended leave. Until you sort out whatever’s happening between you and Mr. Mitchell privately.”

Extended leave.

“With pay,” he adds, as if that’s a salve. “Ryan will handle the transition of your active accounts. Take the time you need. When you’re ready, we’ll talk.”

Of course he will. Of course he gets the accounts. Of course.

The Manhattan lights blur. Brooklyn waits with its honest silence and the brownstone that is, suddenly, very empty.

Thirty-two minutes to Park Slope. Thirty-two minutes to work out how you rebuild when everything that was controlled explodes under a museum skylight.

Well, Tori. You wanted change. Just didn’t expect an audience.

Quick editing notes & tricks you can reuse

Open with a violent sensory verb (cut, slam, throw) to force the reader into the moment.

Use internal calculations (Victoria’s trades/spreadsheet thinking) as voice texture — it’s a character tic that anchors her professionalism even while she’s falling apart.

Vary sentence length aggressively. Cluster 1–3 short sentences, then give one longer ripple to release tension.

Show reputation damage, don’t explain it. Phones, faces, a CEO’s small correction — sensory beats communicate status faster than exposition.

Drop one or two colloquial asides — a parenthetical “Please not livestream” or a sarcastic thought gives personality without heavy-handedness.
