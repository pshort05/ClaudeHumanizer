    "punctuation_restriction": "Use only simple punctuation in replacements: commas, periods, question marks, exclamation points. Never use em dashes (—) or en dashes (–)",
    "dialogue_pause_handling": "For ANY metaphorical or elaborate description of conversational pauses (e.g., 'weight of words', 'silence stretched', 'words hung'), replace with 'Silence.', 'Awkward silence.', or preferably remove entirely",
    "light_description_handling": "For ANY elaborate light descriptions using verbs like 'filtering', 'casting', 'streaming', 'slanting' (e.g., 'sunlight filtered through', 'moonlight reflecting'), replace with simple phrases like 'in the moonlight', 'afternoon sun', or preferably remove entirely",
    "finger_hand_action_handling": "For ANY elaborate finger/hand movement descriptions (e.g., 'fingers dancing across the keyboard', 'fingers hovering over'), replace with direct action verbs like 'typing', 'touched', 'traced'. Ask 'What is the person actually DOING?' and use that verb."
