# **BANNED: THE DEFINITIVE GUIDE**

---

# **PART 2: WORDS AND PHRASES**

## **Purpose**

This section catalogs **specific words and phrases** that weaken prose through overuse, vagueness, or cliché. These are the building blocks of the structural problems in Part 1—the individual terms that signal lazy writing, generic emotion, or AI-generated filler.

**Core Principle:** If a word or phrase could appear unchanged across any character, any genre, any story—it's doing no work. Cut it.

---

## **2.1 PHYSICAL TELLS (EMOTION SUBSTITUTES)**

These get used reflexively instead of actual interiority, psychology, or consequence. They flatten distinct characters into identical nervous systems.

### **Jaw/Face**

* jaw tightens / clenches / sets / locks  
* jaw works  
* muscle jumps / ticks in jaw  
* teeth grind

### **Throat/Breath**

* throat works / bobs  
* swallows hard / thickly  
* breath catches / hitches / stutters  
* breath punched out  
* exhales slowly / shakily  
* releases a breath \[he/she\] didn't know \[he/she\] was holding  
* forgets to breathe

### **Eyes**

* eyes darken / go dark  
* pupils blown / blown wide  
* gaze sharpens / hardens / softens  
* something flickers in \[his/her\] eyes  
* eyes search \[his/her\] face

### **Hands/Body**

* hands curl into fists  
* knuckles whiten  
* fingers flex / twitch at \[his/her\] side  
* hand flexes at side  
* spine straightens / stiffens  
* shoulders tense / drop  
* goes very still  
* freezes

### **Heart/Chest**

* heart stutters / pounds / races  
* chest tightens / aches  
* something cracks / shifts / loosens in \[his/her\] chest

**Why These Fail:** Autonomic responses don't differentiate emotion. Every character ends up with the same body language regardless of psychology, history, or coping patterns.

---

## **2.2 VAGUE INTERIORITY PLACEHOLDERS**

These substitute for naming actual emotions or stakes.

* something in \[him/her\] shifts / breaks / cracks / loosens / changes  
* something unnameable  
* something like \[emotion\]  
* the weight of \[X\] settles / presses / lands  
* a wave of \[emotion\] crashes / washes over  
* \[emotion\] curls / coils in \[his/her\] stomach  
* feels it in \[his/her\] bones  
* the words hang between them  
* the silence stretches / sits heavy / presses  
* the air thickens / shifts / changes  
* the room feels smaller

**Why These Fail:** "Something" signals the writer knows an effect occurred but can't specify what. These phrases tell that change happened without showing how.

---

## **2.3 DEFAULT EMOTION DESCRIPTORS**

Overused intensity markers that have lost all specificity.

* raw  
* visceral  
* primal  
* bone-deep  
* soul-deep  
* marrow-deep  
* paper-thin (control, patience, composure)  
* gossamer-thin  
* razor-thin  
* threadbare  
* frayed edges  
* worn thin  
* stretched to breaking

**Why These Fail:** These words affect intensity without specifying quality. "Raw" anger and "raw" grief and "raw" desire all collapse into the same vague urgency.

---

## **2.4 TRANSITION / BEAT PLACEHOLDERS**

Empty time markers simulating pacing without creating it.

* for a long moment  
* for a beat  
* for a suspended moment  
* after a moment  
* a pause, then  
* finally (as transition)  
* when \[he/she\] speaks, \[his/her\] voice is \[adjective\]  
* the silence that follows is \[adjective\]

**Why These Fail:** These phrases label time passing rather than showing what happens during it. They're stage directions, not lived experience.

---

## **2.5 DIALOGUE TAGS AND MODIFIERS**

Adverbial crutches that tell tone instead of embedding it.

### **Adverbs After Said/Asked**

* softly  
* quietly  
* carefully  
* finally  
* slowly  
* flatly  
* evenly  
* roughly

### **Voice Descriptors**

* voice drops  
* voice tightens  
* voice goes flat  
* voice breaks  
* voice hardens  
* voice softens  
* pitched low  
* barely above a whisper  
* deceptively soft / mild  
* deliberately light  
* falsely casual  
* too casual

**Why These Fail:** If the dialogue needs an adverb to convey tone, the dialogue itself isn't doing its job.

---

## **2.6 GAZE / LOOK DESCRIPTORS**

Overused shorthand for unspoken communication.

* assessing  
* appraising  
* cataloguing  
* tracking  
* watchful  
* guarded  
* shuttered  
* unreadable  
* inscrutable  
* too knowing  
* seeing too much

**Why These Fail:** These create the impression of depth without specifying what's actually being communicated or withheld.

---

## **2.7 PRECISION / CONTROL CLUSTER**

Clinical competence descriptors that flatten characters into identical efficiency.

* surgical precision  
* precision (overuse in general)  
* with practiced ease  
* with practiced efficiency  
* economical movement(s)  
* deliberate and controlled  
* calculated  
* calibrated  
* methodical  
* clinical  
* exacting  
* meticulous

**Why These Fail:** These substitute "impressive" for specific action. Every controlled character ends up sounding the same.

---

## **2.8 COMPETENCE PORN DESCRIPTORS**

Shorthand for capability that tells rather than shows.

* effortless  
* seamless  
* fluid  
* graceful economy  
* wasted no movement  
* efficient brutality  
* quiet competence  
* easy confidence  
* contained power  
* coiled energy  
* deceptive stillness

**Why These Fail:** These describe the impression of competence rather than the specific actions that create it.

---

## **2.9 QUALITY / TEXTURE DEFAULTS**

The same material metaphors applied to every controlled or dangerous character.

* velvet (voice, darkness, threat)  
* silk (over steel, voice)  
* steel (spine, voice, gaze, grip)  
* iron (control, grip, will)  
* granite  
* marble

**Why These Fail:** So overused they're invisible. Find different textures or describe the actual sensation.

---

## **2.10 TEMPERATURE METAPHORS**

Oldest affect shorthand—drains emotional register to binary hot/cold.

* cold (voice, gaze, tone)  
* frozen  
* ice in \[his/her\] veins  
* blood ran cold  
* warmth spread through  
* heat pooled low  
* heat between them  
* fire licked up \[his/her\] spine  
* something molten  
* cold settled in \[his/her\] bones

**Why These Fail:** Temperature is the most generic descriptor for emotion. It narrows the entire emotional spectrum to two options.

---

## **2.11 IMPACT / FORCE PHRASES**

Overused shorthand for emotional shock.

* hit like a physical blow  
* hit like a punch to the gut  
* hit like a freight train  
* landed like a blow  
* struck like a slap  
* knocked the air out of \[him/her\]  
* felt like a gut punch

**Why These Fail:** Makes every revelation feel identical. Removes character-specific response.

---

## **2.12 RIPPLE / STILLNESS PHRASES**

Dead water imagery for emotional impact.

* like a stone dropped in still water  
* rippled through \[him/her\]  
* sent ripples through  
* the stillness shattered  
* cracked the silence like glass

**Why These Fail:** So common they're invisible. No unique sensory or emotional anchor.

---

## **2.13 BREAKING / CRACKING METAPHORS**

Overused for emotional transformation.

* something cracked open  
* split \[him/her\] open  
* broke something loose  
* shattered something \[he/she\] didn't know was fragile  
* fractured the moment  
* splintered  
* hairline fractures  
* fault lines  
* cracks in the foundation

**Why These Fail:** Every emotional shift becomes the same structural failure. No differentiation between types of change.

---

## **2.14 ANCHOR / TETHER METAPHORS**

Default metaphor for emotional dependence.

* anchored \[him/her\]  
* tethered \[him/her\] to \[X\]  
* the only thing keeping \[him/her\] \[grounded/present/sane\]  
* held \[him/her\] in place  
* moored

**Why These Fail:** Turns connection into passivity—something that happens to characters rather than something they choose.

---

## **2.15 EDGE / PRECIPICE METAPHORS**

Overused for emotional instability.

* on the edge of something  
* teetering on the precipice  
* one wrong word from \[falling/breaking/shattering\]  
* barely holding on  
* hanging by a thread

**Why These Fail:** Abstract geography substituting for specific psychological state.

---

## **2.16 SOUND / SILENCE PHRASES**

Anthropomorphized absence.

* the words fell into silence  
* swallowed by the quiet  
* the silence swallowed it  
* deafening silence  
* silence roared  
* the quiet pressed in  
* hangs in the air

**Why These Fail:** Treats silence as an actor rather than showing its effect on characters.

---

## **2.17 TIME / MOMENT PHRASES**

Pseudo-cinematic pause language.

* time stretched  
* the moment crystallized  
* suspended in amber  
* frozen in place  
* the world narrowed to  
* everything else fell away  
* the world held its breath

**Why These Fail:** Evokes camera, not consciousness. Tells reader when to feel tension rather than creating it.

---

## **2.18 PERMISSION / ALLOWANCE CONSTRUCTIONS**

Phrases signaling emotional restraint releasing.

* allowed \[himself/herself\] to \[verb\]  
* let \[himself/herself\] \[verb\]  
* gave \[himself/herself\] permission to  
* permitted \[himself/herself\] the luxury of  
* finally let go of

**Why These Fail:** Labels release rather than showing what changes when restraint drops.

---

## **2.19 REALIZATION / UNDERSTANDING PHRASES**

Shorthand for mental shift.

* it clicked into place  
* the pieces slotted together  
* understanding dawned  
* clarity crashed over \[him/her\]  
* the truth of it settled  
* landed with the force of  
* crystallized

**Why These Fail:** Tells that realization happened rather than showing the thought process or consequence.

---

## **2.20 DANGER / THREAT DESCRIPTORS**

Default vocabulary for menacing characters.

* lethal grace  
* predatory stillness  
* coiled to strike  
* dangerous edge  
* barely contained violence  
* quiet menace  
* soft threat  
* the promise of violence

**Why These Fail:** Every dangerous character gets the same predator-animal vocabulary. No differentiation.

---

## **2.21 SPACE / PRESENCE PHRASES**

Clichés for charismatic characters.

* commanded the room  
* filled the space  
* sucked the air out of the room  
* dominated the space  
* presence that demanded attention  
* gravity (as charisma metaphor)  
* magnetic  
* impossible to ignore

**Why These Fail:** Tell that someone is impressive rather than showing what they do that creates that impression.

---

## **2.22 INTIMACY / CONNECTION PHRASES**

Default vocabulary for emotional closeness.

* the space between them  
* closed the distance  
* breached \[his/her\] defenses  
* slipped past \[his/her\] guard  
* got under \[his/her\] skin  
* burrowed in  
* took root  
* settled into the cracks

**Why These Fail:** Treats intimacy as infiltration rather than choice. Same military/fortress metaphor for every relationship.

---

## **2.23 POSSESSION / CLAIMING PHRASES**

Overused for romantic intensity.

* staked a claim  
* marked \[him/her\]  
* branded into  
* written into \[his/her\] skin  
* carved into \[his/her\] bones

**Why These Fail:** Same branding metaphor for every intense connection. No differentiation between types of possession or why it matters.

---

## **2.24 EMOTIONAL STATE SHORTHAND**

Vocabulary for repression that tells rather than shows.

* tamped down  
* locked down  
* held in check  
* barely leashed  
* tightly controlled  
* white-knuckled control  
* iron grip on \[emotion\]  
* ruthlessly suppressed  
* shoved down

**Why These Fail:** Labels containment without showing the mechanism, cost, or what leaks when it fails.

---

## **2.25 TRANSITION VERBS (OVERUSE)**

Verbs that describe change without specifying what changed.

* shifted  
* settled  
* flickered  
* softened  
* hardened  
* sharpened  
* gentled  
* eased  
* tightened  
* loosened

**Why These Fail:** These become invisible through repetition. They describe that something changed without showing the change.

---

## **2.26 FAUX-EDGY BANTER**

Dialogue patterns that substitute trope familiarity for actual chemistry.

* "You're such a menace."  
* "You're impossible."  
* "You're trouble."  
* "You're the worst."  
* "You're insufferable."  
* "You're ridiculous."  
* "You're going to be the death of me."  
* "\[says something\]" "You love it."

**Why These Fail:** Tonally juvenile. Derives from fandom banter tropes with no psychological grounding. Every character sounds identical regardless of background or dynamic.

---

## **2.27 CINEMATIC WALLPAPER**

Atmospheric filler that delays character presence.

* light spills / pools / catches  
* shadows play across  
* the skyline stretches  
* floor-to-ceiling windows  
* casting \[X\] in sharp relief  
* neon glow  
* ozone smell  
* the city hummed

**Why These Fail:** Set dressing before story. Mimics film language rather than character consciousness.

---

## **2.28 DESCRIPTION CLICHÉS**

Overused body part descriptors.

* orbs / pools (for eyes)  
* alabaster / porcelain / ivory (for skin)  
* mane (for hair)  
* column of neck  
* delicate wrists  
* sharp planes of \[his\] face  
* the line of \[his\] jaw  
* broad shoulders  
* lean muscle

**Why These Fail:** So common they're invisible. Create no specific visual impression.

---

## **2.29 DOMESTIC / CLOTHING FILLER**

Details that pad scenes without narrative function.

### **Clothing**

* shorts  
* tees / t-shirts  
* sweats / sweatpants

* jeans (unless plot-relevant)  
* thin cotton / soft cotton  
* sleeves rolled to the elbow

### **Activities**

* dishwashing  
* folding laundry  
* reading books (as filler)  
* drinking tea / coffee (as filler)  
* flipping through magazines  
* wiping counters  
* tidying

**Why These Fail:** Fake intimacy signal suggesting realism but stalling momentum. Replaces decision, conflict, or risk with neutral busywork.

---

## **2.30 RELIGIOUS EXPRESSIONS**

Exclamations that break voice and default to generic intensity.

* Oh God  
* Oh my God  
* God yes / God no  
* Jesus  
* Christ  
* Lord

**Why These Fail:** Reflexive intensity markers that tell nothing about character. Universal default rather than character-specific expression.

---

## **2.31 ENDING CLICHÉS**

Phrases that close scenes with false profundity rather than consequence.

* And for now, that was enough.  
* It was a start.  
* They would figure it out. Somehow.  
* Nothing would ever be the same.  
* Everything had changed.

**Why These Fail:** Summary posing as closure. Labels the emotional meaning rather than letting it emerge from action.

---

## **2.32 MISCELLANEOUS HIGH-FREQUENCY**

Other overused terms that signal AI-generated or generic prose.

* cut through the noise  
* sliced through  
* pierced through  
* wormed its way into

* threatened to spill over

* the architecture of \[anything\]  
* the geometry of \[anything\]  
* the calculus of \[anything\]  
* the mathematics of \[relationship/emotion\]  
* the grammar of \[intimacy/violence\]

**Why These Fail:** Pseudo-intellectual framing that performs analysis rather than showing character experience.

---

## **2.33 AI VOCABULARY CLUSTER**

These words are disproportionately overrepresented in AI-generated text. Their presence doesn't automatically indicate AI, but clusters of them signal regression to statistically common phrasing rather than specific, character-grounded language.

### **Overused Abstract Nouns**

* tapestry (figurative)  
* landscape (figurative)  
* interplay  
* intricacies  
* nuance / nuanced  
* multifaceted  
* dynamics  
* framework  
* paradigm

### **Overused Verbs**

* delve / delves / delving  
* foster / fostering  
* garner / garnered / garnering  
* underscore / underscoring  
* showcase / showcasing  
* highlight / highlighting (as narrator editorializing)  
* emphasize / emphasizing  
* reflect / reflecting (as narrator editorializing)

* vital  
* vibrant  
* intricate  
* nuanced  
* multifaceted  
* profound  
* compelling  
* poignant

### **Overused Adverbs**

* seemingly  
* arguably  
* notably  
* importantly  
* ultimately  
* fundamentally  
* inherently  
* undeniably  
* understandably

**Why These Fail:** They're statistically common in the training data, so AI defaults to them. They signal "important-sounding" without being specific. In narrative prose, they flatten voice into generic literary register.

---

## **2.34 NARRATOR-AS-ANALYST PHRASES**

These phrases turn narration into editorial commentary, explaining significance rather than dramatizing it.

**Banned Constructions:**

* \[action\], highlighting \[interpretation\]  
* \[action\], underscoring \[meaning\]  
* \[action\], reflecting \[theme\]  
* \[action\], emphasizing \[significance\]  
* \[action\], showcasing \[quality\]  
* \[action\], symbolizing \[abstraction\]  
* \[action\], illustrating \[point\]  
* \[action\], demonstrating \[trait\]

**Why These Fail:** The narrator steps outside the scene to tell the reader what something means. If the action requires interpretation, the action itself is underwritten.

---

## **2.35 LEGACY/IMPORTANCE PUFFERY**

These phrases inflate significance through assertion rather than demonstration. Rare in good fiction, ubiquitous in AI output.

**Banned Phrases:**

* stands as a testament to  
* serves as a reminder of  
* a testament to  
* enduring legacy  
* lasting legacy  
* lasting impact  
* indelible mark  
* deeply rooted  
* profound heritage  
* steadfast dedication  
* plays a vital/pivotal/crucial role  
* of paramount importance  
* cannot be overstated

**Why These Fail:** These tell the reader something matters without showing why. In fiction, significance is earned through consequence, not declared through diction.

---

## **2.36 PROMOTIONAL/BROCHURE LANGUAGE**

These phrases derive from travel writing, marketing copy, and promotional materials. They appear in AI output when describing places, experiences, or qualities.

**Banned Phrases:**

* nestled (unless literal geography)  
* in the heart of  
* boasts a  
* stunning \[anything\]  
* breathtaking \[anything\]  
* continues to captivate  
* rich tapestry of  
* vibrant culture/community/scene  
* bustling  
* picturesque  
* idyllic

**Why These Fail:** These are advertising words. They tell the reader to be impressed rather than creating the impression through specific detail.

# **PART 3: GUIDELINES**

## **Purpose**

This section provides the **operational framework** for applying Parts 1 and 2\. It explains why these bans exist, what to do instead, and how to systematically check your work.

**Core Principle:** Every banned element shares one root cause—substituting form for content, decoration for precision, or familiar rhythm for earned meaning. The corrective is always the same: be specific, be embodied, show consequence.

---

## **3.1 THE ROOT PROBLEM**

All banned constructions, words, and phrases fail for the same reasons:

### **They Simulate Rather Than Create**

* Rhythm that sounds literary but carries no meaning  
* Gestures that look like emotion but specify nothing  
* Metaphors that feel poetic but clarify nothing

### **They Are Interchangeable**

* Could appear in any story, any genre, any character  
* Reveal nothing specific about this person in this moment  
* Function as placeholder until the writer figures out what's actually happening

### **They Tell Rather Than Show**

* Label that emotion occurred rather than dramatizing it  
* Announce that time passed rather than showing what filled it  
* Declare that something changed rather than making the change visible

### **They Default to Familiar**

* Reach for the first phrase that comes to mind  
* Rely on reader recognition of trope rather than earned response  
* Substitute genre convention for character-specific behavior

---

## **3.2 THE CORRECTIVE FRAMEWORK**

When you catch a banned element, apply these questions:

### **For Physical Tells**

**Ask:** How does *this specific character* show this emotion? What's their particular outlet—displacement activity, speech pattern change, postural shift?

### **For Vague Interiority**

**Ask:** What is actually happening? What would an observer see? What would the character physically feel or specifically think?

### **For Metaphors**

**Ask:** Does this comparison clarify or decorate? Does the vehicle share actual properties with the tenor, or does it just sound good?

### **For Dialogue Tags**

**Ask:** Can the line carry its own tone? If I remove the modifier, does the reader still understand how it's delivered?

### **For Transitions**

**Ask:** What happens during this pause? Who breaks first? What's the cost of the waiting?

### **For Endings**

**Ask:** What action, decision, or consequence closes this beat? What changes because of what just happened?

---

## **3.3 WHAT TO DO INSTEAD**

### **Instead of Generic Physical Tells**

* Identify each character's specific stress responses  
* Tie physical behavior to established psychology  
* Show displacement activities that reveal coping patterns  
* Let the body do something that advances the scene

### **Instead of Vague Emotion Words**

* Name the specific emotion: anger, fear, grief, shame, desire, relief  
* Show the thought pattern that accompanies the feeling  
* Demonstrate the behavioral consequence of the state  
* Reveal what the character wants to do but can't or won't

### **Instead of Dead Metaphors**

* Describe the sensation directly  
* Ground comparison in the character's specific frame of reference  
* Cut the metaphor entirely if direct description works better  
* Test: does this image clarify or just decorate?

### **Instead of Atmospheric Front-Loading**

* Start with character in action or decision  
* Introduce environment through character perception, not camera pan  
* Let setting emerge from what the character notices and why  
* Anchor atmosphere in sensory detail that matters to the scene

### **Instead of Stillness Endings**

* End on a micro-action that crystallizes the emotional state  
* Close with dialogue that shifts the dynamic  
* Cut the scene earlier—before the false profundity  
* Let consequence land rather than announcing that it landed

### **Instead of Echo-Line Poetics**

* If the second line doesn't add information, cut it  
* Combine into single sentence with actual movement  
* Escalate, complicate, or contradict—don't just rephrase  
* Trust single statements to carry weight

---

## **3.4 PRE-DRAFT PROTOCOL**

Before writing any scene, confirm these commitments:

**Structural:**

* \[ \] I will vary sentence rhythm—no mechanical "X, then Y" patterns  
* \[ \] I will not rely on triple-beat lists or staccato fragments for false emphasis  
* \[ \] I will start with character presence, not atmospheric establishing shots  
* \[ \] I will end on action, decision, or consequence—not stillness or summary

**Language:**

* \[ \] I will use no adverbs on dialogue tags  
* \[ \] I will not use "something" as an emotion placeholder  
* \[ \] I will not describe silence/air/atmosphere as an active force  
* \[ \] I will name specific emotions rather than "raw," "weight," or "need"

**Physical Description:**

* \[ \] Each character has distinct physical tells for tension, desire, and restraint  
* \[ \] I will not default to jaw/throat/hand clichés  
* \[ \] Breathing only matters if it changes scene tempo or power dynamic

**Metaphor:**

* \[ \] No gravitational language for attraction  
* \[ \] No temperature as emotion shorthand  
* \[ \] No dead similes (stone in water, physical blow, hangs in air)  
* \[ \] Every comparison must clarify, not decorate

---

## **3.5 MID-DRAFT FLAGGING PROTOCOL**

When you catch yourself writing a banned element, stop immediately and redirect:

| If You Write... | Stop and Ask... |
| ----- | ----- |
| ", then" | Does this sequence reveal psychology, or am I just choreographing? |
| "something" | What exactly is happening? |
| "silence stretches/hangs" | What is the effect on who? |
| "not X, but Y" | What is this actually? Can I commit? |
| adverb after "said" | Can the line carry its own tone? |
| "voice drops/tightens" | Can I show this through rhythm or action? |
| jaw/throat/hand tension | How does THIS character show restraint? |
| "finally" | Who yields first? What breaks the stalemate? |
| "raw" | What is the actual emotion? |
| "carefully" | Why? What would happen if they weren't careful? |
| "like a blow" | What does this actually feel like in the body? |
| "need" without object | Need for what? From whom? Why? |
| weather/skyline opening | Where is the character? What are they doing? |
| domestic activity | Does this create friction, or am I padding? |
| "changed everything" | Is this moment actually that big? |

---

### **Phase 11: AI Vocabulary**

**Search:** delve / tapestry / landscape / pivotal / crucial / vibrant / highlighting / underscoring **Action:** Replace with specific, character-grounded language

### **Phase 12: Elegant Variation**

**Search:** "the older man" / "the younger woman" / descriptor cycling **Action:** Use names unless descriptor does specific work

---

## **3.7 THE FINAL TEST**

Before any piece is complete, run these checks:

### **Specificity Test**

* Could any line appear unchanged in a different story with different characters?  
* If yes, it's not specific enough. Rewrite.

### **Interchangeability Test**

* Could this physical tell / metaphor / ending belong to any character?  
* If yes, it's not character-specific. Rewrite.

### **Consequence Test**

* Does something change because of this scene / beat / line?  
* If nothing changes, the scene isn't done.

### **Decoration Test**

* Does this metaphor / description / sensory detail clarify or just ornament?  
* If it only ornaments, cut it.

### **Earned Test**

* Has this emotional beat been built to, or am I announcing it?  
* If announced, either build the foundation or scale down.

---

## **3.8 WHEN RULES CONFLICT**

### **Specificity vs. Brevity**

* Specificity wins. A longer line that does work beats a shorter line that decorates.

### **Character Voice vs. Ban List**

* If a specific character would genuinely use a banned term in dialogue, flag it and use sparingly with clear justification.  
* Narration has no such excuse.

### **Rhythm vs. Clarity**

* Clarity wins. A clunky sentence that communicates beats a smooth sentence that obscures.

### **Convention vs. Precision**

* Precision wins. An unfamiliar construction that fits beats a familiar one that doesn't.

---

## **3.9 THE OPERATING PRINCIPLE**

This guide is not about restriction—it's about clearing space for the story that actually matters.

Every banned element is a shortcut that prevents the writer from doing the harder, better work of:

* Figuring out what's actually happening  
* Understanding how this specific character would respond  
* Building tension through structure rather than announcing it through diction  
* Trusting the reader to feel what's been earned rather than being told what to feel

The bans exist to force precision. The precision serves the story.

---

## **3.10 THE AI PATTERN PROBLEM**

Beyond bad craft, many banned patterns are identifiable AI tells. This matters for two reasons:

**1\. Detection Risk** Readers increasingly recognize AI-generated prose. Patterns that signal AI origin break immersion and undermine trust in the narrative voice.

**2\. The Underlying Failure Is the Same** AI defaults to statistically common patterns because it lacks specific knowledge of character, scene, and consequence. When human writers use the same patterns, they're making the same error—substituting generic rhythm for specific meaning.

The AI detection problem and the craft problem share a root cause: regression to the mean. AI writing sounds like AI writing because it's averaging across millions of texts. Human writing that sounds like AI writing is doing the same thing unconsciously.

**The corrective is identical:** Be specific. Ground every description in character perception. Make every gesture do work. Let consequence emerge from action rather than being announced by narration.

---

## **3.11 THE ELEGANT VARIATION TRAP**

AI cycles through synonyms to avoid repetition, producing constructions like:

* "the protagonist" → "the key player" → "the central figure"  
* "\[CHARACTER\]" → "the older man" → "her husband" → "the architect"

This is mechanical avoidance, not craft.

**The Rule:** Use names unless the descriptor is doing specific work:

* Establishing POV ("the man she used to love")  
* Marking emotional distance ("the stranger wearing her husband's face")  
* Shifting power dynamic ("the woman he'd underestimated")

If the descriptor is just avoiding the name, use the name.

---

## **3.12 NARRATOR DISTANCE**

AI narration tends toward analysis—explaining what things mean rather than dramatizing them. This produces constructions like:

* "She closed the door, highlighting her need for space."  
* "He laughed, a sound that underscored his discomfort."

The narrator is stepping outside the scene to editorialize.

**The Rule:** Narration should remain inside character perception or inside the scene's physical reality. The moment narration starts explaining significance, it has become essay rather than fiction.

If an action needs interpretation, either:

1. The action is underwritten and needs to be more specific  
2. The interpretation belongs in character interiority, not narrator commentary  
3. The interpretation should be cut—trust the reader

---

# **PART 4: EROTICA-SPECIFIC GUIDELINES**

## **Purpose**

This section governs **explicit sexual content**. It builds on Parts 1-3 but addresses the specific failure modes of erotic writing: euphemism, abstraction, cartoonish physicality, and trope substitution for psychology.

**Core Principle:** Erotic scenes must be embodied, realistic, and psychologically grounded. Sex is action—it follows the same rules as any other scene. Something must change. Consequence must be visible. Character voice must remain distinct.

---

## **4.1 LANGUAGE BANS**

### **Euphemisms**

These sanitize or romanticize body parts and functions. They signal discomfort with explicitness or default to romance-novel convention.

**Banned terms:**

* slick (as noun)  
* spend  
* release (as noun for orgasm)  
* essence  
* fluids  
* cream  
* core  
* length  
* folds  
* womanhood  
* member  
* sex (as noun for genitals)  
* center  
* heat (as noun for genitals)  
* entrance  
* channel  
* sheath

### **Romance Fluff**

Transcendence framing that aestheticizes sex into abstraction.

**Banned phrases:**

* joined as one  
* two become one  
* soul-touched  
* souls entwined  
* made love (as euphemism for fucked)  
* completed \[him/her\]  
* transcendent  
* sacred union

---

## **4.2 RELIGIOUS LANGUAGE BANS**

Religious exclamations and metaphors that default to generic intensity or impose reverence framing on intimacy.

### **Exclamations**

* Oh God  
* Oh my God  
* God yes / God no  
* Jesus  
* Christ  
* Lord  
* Dear God  
* God help \[me/him/her\]

### **Metaphors**

* worship  
* worshipped  
* altar  
* sacred  
* divine  
* prayer  
* scripture  
* communion  
* reverence  
* devotion (in religious sense)  
* blessing

**Why These Fail:** Religious language imposes a reverence frame that aestheticizes rather than embodies. It also defaults to generic intensity rather than character-specific expression.

---

## **4.3 SWEAT AND PERSPIRATION BANS**

Sweat description becomes filler that substitutes for actual tension, exertion, or heat.

**Banned terms/phrases:**

* forehead sheen  
* damp curls  
* skin slick (with sweat)  
* beading sweat  
* glistening  
* humid  
* clammy  
* perspiration  
* sweat-slicked  
* dewy

**Use Instead:** Heat, tremor, breath, muscle tension. Wetness in erotic scenes comes from arousal, come, lube, spit—not decorative perspiration.

---

## **4.4 PORNO TROPE BANS**

Cartoonish physicality that substitutes for realistic sex.

### **Motion Verbs**

* slamming  
* impaling  
* pistoning  
* pounding (as default rhythm)  
* jackhammering  
* drilling  
* plowing

### **Vocalization**

* screamed (during orgasm)  
* screaming in ecstasy  
* shrieked  
* wailed  
* howled

### **Fluid Exaggeration**

* rivers of come  
* endless streams  
* flooded  
* drenched (in come)  
* gallons  
* impossible volumes

### **Cliché Phrases**

* buried to the hilt  
* balls deep (as the only depth descriptor)  
* smelled of sex  
* tasted of salt  
* the musky scent of arousal  
* her arousal evident

### **Kissing Clichés**

* tongues battling for dominance  
* tongues dueling  
* all teeth and tongue  
* devoured \[his/her\] mouth

### **Touch Clichés**

* tracing patterns  
* tracing lazy circles  
* featherlight touches  
* whisper-soft  
* butterfly kisses

---

## **4.5 VOCAL DESCRIPTOR BANS**

Overused sound tags that flatten distinct voices.

**Banned terms:**

* guttural  
* keening  
* mewling  
* whimpering (overuse)  
* breathy moan  
* grunted  
* growled (as default male vocalization)

**Use Instead:** rough, torn, low, broken, caught, strangled, bitten-off. Or describe the actual sound rather than labeling it.

---

## **4.6 AFTERMATH CLICHÉ BANS**

Post-climax descriptors that have lost all meaning through overuse.

**Banned terms:**

* spent  
* ruined  
* wrecked  
* undone  
* boneless  
* shattered  
* destroyed  
* broken (in pleasurable sense)  
* liquefied

**Why These Fail:** These tell that intensity occurred rather than showing the specific state of the body or mind after.

---

## **4.7 POSITION AND MOTION BANS**

Physical impossibilities and lazy shorthand.

### **Anatomical Implausibility**

* pinning wrists above head (in positions where leverage doesn't work)  
* constant hip-gripping while thrusting (physically impossible to maintain grip \+ leverage)  
* one-thrust full penetration (with any significant size)  
* standing sex without support (wall, counter, furniture, or being held)

### **Intensity Shorthand**

* gripped hard enough to bruise (as default intensity marker—actual bruising requires abuse-level force)  
* nails drawing blood (unless intentional and addressed)  
* bit hard enough to mark (unless intentional and addressed)

### **Lazy Choreography**

* fisting sheets (overused)  
* gripping headboard (overused)  
* arching off the bed (overused)  
* toes curling (overused)  
* head thrown back (overused)

---

## **4.8 DARK ROMANCE TROPE BANS**

Power dynamic clichés that substitute for actual psychology.

**Banned framings:**

* Daddy/dom aesthetic or pet names  
* humiliation play (unless explicitly established as character dynamic)  
* alpha-asshole framing (dominance as swagger rather than psychology)  
* clingy/groveling partner framing (need as pathetic rather than human)  
* possession as ownership rather than devotion  
* "teaching" or "training" framing without consent context  
* punishment framing for pleasure

---

## **4.9 RACE AND ETHNICITY BANS**

Fetishization language that reduces characters to racial/ethnic tropes.

**Banned terms:**

* exotic  
* chocolate  
* ebony  
* caramel  
* mocha  
* coffee  
* any food comparison for skin  
* savage  
* primal (in racial context)  
* submissive Asian  
* stoic Oriental  
* dragon lady  
* geisha  
* lotus blossom  
* any animal comparison for racialized features

**Banned framings:**

* martial arts / monk / samurai metaphors for Asian men (unless literal context)  
* "jungle" or "wild" framing for Black characters  
* "spicy" or "fiery" framing for Latina characters  
* any framing that reduces a character to racial stereotype

---

## **4.10 ABSTRACT CONCEPT BANS**

Philosophy and analysis language that breaks embodiment.

**Banned in erotic dialogue:**

* structure  
* anchor  
* submission (as abstract concept)  
* dominance (as abstract concept)  
* power exchange  
* dynamic  
* connection  
* intimacy (as spoken word during sex)  
* any therapy-speak or relationship-analysis language during the act

**Why These Fail:** Characters in the middle of sex don't narrate the psychology of what they're doing. They act. Analysis belongs in meta-discussion, not in-scene dialogue.

---

## **4.11 POSITIVE GUIDANCE: LANGUAGE**

### **Plain Terms (Use These)**

* pussy  
* cock  
* clit  
* come (noun and verb)  
* precome  
* wetness

* ache (physical, earned)  
* tender  
* swollen  
* marked (when earned and plausible)

---

## **4.12 POSITIVE GUIDANCE: DIALOGUE**

Erotic dialogue should be:

* Filthy  
* Clipped  
* Character-specific  
* Tied to action or demand

### **Effective Dialogue Types**

* Commands: "Stay open." "Don't move." "Deeper." "Again."  
* Demands: "Harder." "More." "Don't stop." "Look at me."  
* Reactions: "Fuck." "Right there." "Yes." "Please."  
* Observations: "So tight." "You're shaking." "You're close."  
* Questions: "Too much?" "You want this?" "Can you take more?"  
* Praise: "Good." "Perfect." "That's it."

### **Dialogue Should NOT Be**

* Philosophical  
* Analytical  
* Explaining the dynamic while in it  
* Narrating what's happening  
* Theme statements about love/sex/power  
* Speeches

---

## **4.13 POSITIVE GUIDANCE: CONSENT**

### **Consent Shown in Action**

* Obedience to positioning  
* Staying open / still / available  
* Repositioning self for better access  
* Asking for more  
* Verbal confirmation without rote formula  
* Active participation  
* Reaching for partner  
* Guiding hands / mouth / body

### **Consent NOT Shown Through**

* Scripted consent speeches  
* Legal-contract language  
* Interrupting action for formal check-ins (unless character-specific)  
* Narration explaining that consent was given

---

## **4.14 POSITIVE GUIDANCE: AFTERCARE**

Aftercare should be visible and specific:

* Touch (stroking, holding, adjusting position)  
* Practical care (water, food, cleaning up)  
* Banter or teasing  
* Silence that's comfortable rather than tense  
* Physical closeness or deliberate space  
* Acknowledgment of what just happened through action

Aftercare should NOT be:

* Moralized  
* A "lesson learned" moment  
* A therapy session about the sex  
* Narrated explanation of why aftercare matters

---

## **4.15 CONTRAST AND DESCRIPTION**

### **Erotic Contrast (Permitted)**

Visual and tactile contrast between bodies is erotic when:

* It serves the scene and action  
* It's grounded in what characters perceive  
* It doesn't reduce any character to their appearance  
* It avoids fetishization language

### **Contrast Should NOT Be**

* The primary focus over action or psychology  
* Described using banned racial/ethnic terms  
* Decorative without function  
* Repetitive (once established, don't keep restating)

---

## **4.16 REALISM REQUIREMENTS**

### **Anatomy**

* Large penetration requires adjustment, easing in, accommodation  
* One-thrust full penetration is not realistic with significant size  
* Position affects depth, angle, and what's possible  
* Bodies have weight, leverage limitations, and fatigue

### **Physics**

* Standing sex requires support  
* Certain grips are impossible to maintain during certain motions  
* Height differences create logistics that must be addressed  
* Flexibility has limits

### **Vocalization**

* Realistic sounds: moans, gasps, caught breath, rough exhale, low curse, bitten-off sound, voice breaking  
* Not realistic: screaming orgasms, constant loud moaning, theatrical vocalization

### **Fluids**

* Realistic amounts, even with high volume  
* Mess is specific and located  
* Cleanup or acknowledgment exists

---

## **4.17 SCENE STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS**

### **Every Erotic Scene Must**

* Change something (trust, power, dynamic, knowledge, relationship)  
* Have identifiable POV (maximum two)  
* Anchor in specific time, place, and circumstance  
* End on action, decision, rupture, or external interruption

### **Every Erotic Scene Must NOT**

* Exist in isolation from story psychology  
* End on summary or fade-out  
* End on stillness without consequence  
* Serve only as "reward" with no narrative function

---

## **4.18 ENDING REQUIREMENTS**

### **End On**

* Collapse (physical)  
* Command (verbal)  
* Rupture (emotional shift)  
* External event (interruption, intrusion)  
* Decision (what happens next)  
* Touch (specific, meaningful)  
* Breath (when it carries weight)  
* Mess (when it crystallizes the scene)

### **Do NOT End On**

* Summary of what just happened  
* Fade-to-black  
* Stillness without cost  
* "And for now, that was enough" or equivalent  
* Narrated emotional meaning

# **APPENDIX: MASTER QUICK-SCAN**

---

## **The Final Principle**

Every banned element shares one root cause: **substituting form for content, decoration for precision, or familiar rhythm for earned meaning.**

The corrective is always the same: **Be specific. Be embodied. Show consequence.**

If a line exists to sound literary, cut it. If a gesture is generic, make it individual. If a metaphor doesn't clarify, delete it. If nothing changes, the scene isn't done.
