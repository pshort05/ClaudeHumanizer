# ClaudeHumanizer Changelog

## Version 2.5.0 - 2025-10-07

### Major Architecture Changes

#### Master Prohibited Words Consolidation
**Problem Solved:** Eliminated duplicate word lists across multiple phases, reducing maintenance burden and preventing list drift.

**Changes:**
- ✅ **Phase 2 (AI Word Cleaning)**: Removed `old_prohibited_list` array containing 400+ entries
- ✅ **Phase 8 (Strategic Imperfections)**: Removed `forbidden_elements` section containing:
  - `prohibited_words` (127 words)
  - `prohibited_phrases` (72 phrases)
  - `ai_isms_limited_use` section
  - `language_to_minimize` subcategories

**Single Source of Truth:** All phases now reference `master_prohibited_words.json` for word filtering

**Word Filtering Responsibility:**
- **Phase 2**: Primary AI word cleaning (first pass)
- **Phase 10**: Final AI word sweep (catches reintroduced words)
- **All other phases**: Focus on their specialized domains, no word filtering

---

### Anti-Hallucination Framework

Added standardized anti-hallucination framework to all prompts for content preservation and factual accuracy.

**Framework Structure:**
```json
"anti_hallucination_framework": {
  "preservation_requirement": "Never alter the original meaning, tone, or author's intended voice",
  "factual_accuracy": "Maintain all factual content exactly as presented in the original",
  "context_sensitivity": "Preserve language that serves specific stylistic or characterization purposes"
}
```

**Phases Updated:**
- ✅ **Phase 2** (2_ai_word_cleaning.json:31-35)
- ✅ **Phase 10** (10_final_ai_word_sweep.json:54-58)

**Phases Already Had Framework:**
- Phase 1: Grammar Foundation
- Phase 3: Overwritten Language Reduction
- Phase 4: Sensory Enhancement
- Phase 5: Subtlety Creation
- Phase 6: Dialogue Enhancement
- Phase 6.1: Character Dialogue Pass
- Phase 7: Weak Language Cleanup
- Phase 8: Strategic Imperfections
- Phase 9: Final Verification

---

### Phase-Specific Clarifications

#### Phase 8: Strategic Imperfections
**Refined Focus:** Rhythm variation and strategic imperfections WITHIN existing sentences

**Clarifications Added:**
- Does NOT perform word filtering (Phases 2 & 10 handle this)
- Works on flow and pacing without changing content meaning
- May split/combine sentences and adjust word order
- MUST NOT change what's shown vs told (Phase 5's domain)
- Added master_prohibited_list_reference on line 88

**Updated Sections:**
- `success_criteria`: Changed from "Eliminated all prohibited words" to "Applied strategic imperfections and rhythm variations"
- `editing_principles`: Reworded to focus on rhythm rather than word replacement

---

#### Phase 9: Final Verification
**Clarified Role:** AI Pattern Detection (not word filtering)

**Key Distinctions from Phase 8:**

| Aspect | Phase 8: Strategic Imperfections | Phase 9: Final Verification |
|--------|----------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Approach** | Constructive - ADD natural rhythm | Reactive - DETECT AI patterns |
| **Focus** | Build natural flow into clean text | Find and fix AI-specific markers |
| **Method** | Vary sentence structure proactively | Pattern matching for AI indicators |
| **Analogy** | Interior designer (make lived-in) | Inspector (check for "showroom perfect") |

**Phase 9 Detection Frameworks:**
1. **AI Perfection Syndrome**
   - Unnaturally flawless grammar/punctuation
   - Uniform sentence lengths
   - Perfect metaphor consistency
   - Triplet pattern overuse (three examples everywhere)

2. **Phrase Repetition Patterns**
   - Scans for phrases (3+ words) appearing more than once
   - Creates frequency map
   - Varies repeated phrases with alternatives

3. **Linguistic Predictability**
   - Common AI phrases ("at its core", "that being said")
   - Overused transitions ("Furthermore", "Additionally")
   - Robotic qualifiers ("It should be emphasized")

4. **Perplexity Enhancement**
   - Unexpected word choices AI wouldn't predict
   - Surprising sentence constructions

---

### Master List References

All prompts now clearly reference master_prohibited_words.json:

**Phases with Direct Usage:**
- Phase 2: AI Word Cleaning - Uses master list with pattern rules
- Phase 10: Final AI Word Sweep - Uses master list with pattern rules

**Phases with Reference Note:**
- Phase 5: Notes Phases 2 & 10 handle filtering
- Phase 6: Notes Phases 2 & 10 handle filtering
- Phase 6.1: References master list
- Phase 7: References master list (keeps instructional examples)
- Phase 8: References master list
- Phase 9: Notes Phase 10 handles filtering

**Instructional Examples Preserved:**
- Phase 7 retains `target_language_categories` with examples of:
  - puff_words, empty_calorie_words, inflation_words
  - weasel_words, hedge_words, filter_phrases
  - cliches_buzzwords, formal_hedging, redundant_phrases
  - correlative_conjunctions, conversational_idioms
  - overused_transitions, robotic_qualifiers

These are teaching examples showing what patterns to detect, not filtering lists.

### N8N Automation

#### New Documentation
- **File Created:** `docs/n8n_workflow_sample.json`
- **Complete 10-phase workflow** with proper connections
- **Claude Sonnet 4.5 configuration** for all phases
- **Temperature settings optimized** per phase:
  - Phase 1: 0.2 (precision)
  - Phase 2: 0.4 (pattern matching)
  - Phase 3: 0.3 (literary judgment)
  - Phase 4: 0.7 (creative sensory)
  - Phase 5: 0.5 (subtlety)
  - Phase 6: 1.0 (dialogue naturalness)
  - Phase 7: 0.2 (systematic)
  - Phase 8: 0.9 (rhythm variation)
  - Phase 9: 0.2 (pattern detection)
  - Phase 10: 0.3 (surgical cleanup)

#### Workflow Features
- **Webhook trigger** for POST requests

3. Configure Anthropic API credentials
4. Activate workflow
5. Send POST request to webhook URL with:
   ```json
   {
     "text": "Your text to humanize here..."
   }
   ```

## Migration Guide

### From Previous Versions

**If you were using custom word lists in Phase 8:**
1. Move any custom words to `master_prohibited_words.json`
2. Phase 8 will automatically use them via Phase 10's final sweep

**If you were relying on Phase 9 for word filtering:**
1. No action needed - Phase 10 now handles this
2. Phase 9 focuses on AI pattern detection

**If you customized Phase 2's old_prohibited_list:**
1. Merge your custom entries into `master_prohibited_words.json`
2. Remove any local modifications to Phase 2's prompt

---

## Technical Improvements

### Memory Optimization
- Reduced duplicate word storage across phases
- Single master list loaded once (Phases 2 & 10 only)
- Phases 3-9 no longer load word lists unnecessarily

### Maintainability
- One list to update instead of multiple
- Prevents list drift between phases
- Clear separation of concerns (word filtering vs. domain processing)

### Consistency
- All prohibited words treated identically across all phases
- Pattern rules (dialogue pause, light, finger actions) applied uniformly
- No risk of missing words due to incomplete lists

---

## Breaking Changes

None. This update is backward compatible.

**Reason:** All changes are internal to prompt architecture. The external API, file structure, and usage patterns remain unchanged.

---

## Future Roadmap

### Planned Improvements
- [ ] Additional pattern rules in master_prohibited_words.json
- [ ] Phase 6.1 character templates for common archetypes
- [ ] Automated quality metrics dashboard
- [ ] Make.com workflow templates
- [ ] Zapier integration guides

### Under Consideration
- [ ] Phase 11: Genre-specific polish
- [ ] Optional Phase 6.2: Accent/dialect handling
- [ ] Batch processing optimization
- [ ] Web UI for non-technical users
