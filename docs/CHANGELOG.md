#### Prompt Standardization System (NEW)

**New Files Created:**

1. **`PROMPT_TEMPLATE.json`** - Master template for all phase prompts
   - Every section tagged as [REQUIRED], [OPTIONAL], or [PHASE-SPECIFIC]
   - Inline comments explaining usage
   - Placeholders and examples for standard fields
   - Copy-paste starting point for new phases

2. **`PROMPT_STANDARDS.md`** - Standardization documentation
   - Section order requirements
   - Naming conventions for consistency
   - Standard wording for common sections
   - Common mistakes to avoid
   - Quality audit checklist

3. **`validate_prompt.py`** - Automated validation script
   - Checks structure, required sections, standardized wording
   - Color-coded output (errors/warnings/info)
   - Single file or bulk validation: `python validate_prompt.py --all`
   - Exit codes for CI/CD integration

4. **`STANDARDIZATION_SUMMARY.md`** - Implementation overview
   - System benefits and usage instructions
   - Current state assessment
   - Next steps and recommendations

**Standard Structure Established:**
```
1. HEADER BLOCK (title, version, date, assembly_line_position, description)
2. DOMAIN RESTRICTIONS (only_handle, never_touch, respect_assembly_line)
3. PERSONA & FRAMEWORK (persona, agent_directives, anti_hallucination_framework)
4. SPECIAL NOTES (optional: master list reference, word filtering notes, etc.)
5. PHASE-SPECIFIC CONTENT (variable by phase, standardized naming)
6. OUTPUT FORMAT (standardized block, identical across all phases)
7. CRITICAL_FINAL_INSTRUCTION (standardized wording)
```

**Standardized Components:**
- **never_touch list**: Must include 4 standard items across all phases
- **agent_directives**: Exactly 3 fields (persistence, tool_usage, deliberate_planning)
- **anti_hallucination_framework**: Exactly 3 fields
- **output_format**: Entire block identical except [bracketed] placeholders
- **Naming conventions**: Use `processing_instructions` (not "core_instructions" or "processing_steps")

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Consistent structure across all prompts
- ✅ Easier to create new phases (copy template)
- ✅ Better maintainability (know where to find instructions)
- ✅ Automated validation catches missing sections
- ✅ Improved LLM comprehension (predictable context structure)

**Documentation Updates:**
- Updated `CLAUDE.md` with standardization workflow
- Updated `README.md` with "For Developers" section
- Added validation instructions to development workflow

### Migration Notes

**For Prompt Developers:**
- Use `PROMPT_TEMPLATE.json` when creating new phases
- Run `python validate_prompt.py <file>.json` before committing changes
- Follow naming conventions in `PROMPT_STANDARDS.md`
- Existing prompts still work but can be incrementally standardized

**For End Users:**
- No changes to workflow or usage
- All optimizations maintain full functionality
- Phase prompts are now more concise and consistent

## Version 3.0.0 - 2025-10-26

### Major Updates

#### Phase Version Updates
- **Phase 8 (Strategic Imperfections)**: v4.1.0 (2025-10-26)
- **Phase 9 (Final Verification)**: v17.0.0 (2025-10-26) - REFACTORED
- **Phase 9.5 (Statistical Analysis Hub)**: v2.0.0 (2025-10-26) - NEW ARCHITECTURE
- **Phase 10 (Final AI Word Sweep)**: v3.0.0 (2025-10-26) - SIMPLIFIED

#### Architectural Refinements

**Phase 9/9.5/10 Separation of Concerns:**

The system now features clear separation between three distinct types of processing:

| Phase | Focus | Type | Purpose |
|-------|-------|------|---------|
| Phase 9 | Pattern Replacement | QUALITATIVE | N-grams, formulaic phrases, AI patterns |
| Phase 9.5 | Statistical Optimization | QUANTITATIVE | Burstiness, POS distribution, TTR |
| Phase 10 | Word Filtering | FILTERING | Prohibited words only |

**Phase 9 (v17.0.0) - Qualitative Pattern Detection:**
- Focuses EXCLUSIVELY on qualitative pattern replacement
- N-gram filtering (150+ common AI n-gram patterns)
- Perplexity optimization (formulaic phrase replacement)
- AI perfection syndrome detection
- Phrase repetition detection and variation
- NO statistical analysis (moved to Phase 9.5)
- NO word filtering (handled by Phase 10)

**Phase 9.5 (v2.0.0) - Statistical Analysis Hub:**
- NEW ARCHITECTURE: Consolidated single-pass statistical analysis
- Measures ALL quantitative metrics together: burstiness, POS distribution, lexical diversity (TTR)
- Single-pass efficiency: reads text once, calculates all metrics, makes coordinated optimizations
- Optional detailed metrics report available
- OPTIONAL phase: can be skipped for budget savings (10-15% cost reduction)
- Skip when: text already has good statistical properties, budget constraints, fast turnaround needed

**Phase 10 (v3.0.0) - Pure Word Filtering:**
- SIMPLIFIED: Now focuses EXCLUSIVELY on word-level filtering
- Uses master_prohibited_words.json with pattern rules
- NO statistical analysis (moved to Phase 9.5)
- Final quality control checkpoint for prohibited words

**Benefits of This Architecture:**
1. **Single-Pass Efficiency**: Phase 9.5 calculates all metrics simultaneously instead of multiple passes
2. **Coordinated Optimization**: Statistical metrics balanced together, not independently optimized
3. **Clear Boundaries**: Qualitative (9) vs Quantitative (9.5) vs Filtering (10)
4. **Budget Flexibility**: Phase 9.5 optional for 10-15% cost savings
5. **Better Maintenance**: Each phase has single, well-defined responsibility

## Version 2.5.0 - 2025-10-07

### Major Architecture Changes

#### Master Prohibited Words Consolidation
**Problem Solved:** Eliminated duplicate word lists across multiple phases, reducing maintenance burden and preventing list drift.

**Changes:**
- ✅ **Phase 2 (AI Word Cleaning)**: Removed `old_prohibited_list` array containing 400+ entries
- ✅ **Phase 8 (Strategic Imperfections)**: Removed `forbidden_elements` section containing:
  - `prohibited_words` (127 words)
  - `prohibited_phrases` (72 phrases)
  - `ai_isms_limited_use` section
  - `language_to_minimize` subcategories

**Single Source of Truth:** All phases now reference `master_prohibited_words.json` for word filtering

**Word Filtering Responsibility:**
- **Phase 2**: Primary AI word cleaning (first pass)
- **Phase 10**: Final AI word sweep (catches reintroduced words)
- **All other phases**: Focus on their specialized domains, no word filtering

---

### Anti-Hallucination Framework

Added standardized anti-hallucination framework to all prompts for content preservation and factual accuracy.

**Framework Structure:**
```json
"anti_hallucination_framework": {
  "preservation_requirement": "Never alter the original meaning, tone, or author's intended voice",
  "factual_accuracy": "Maintain all factual content exactly as presented in the original",
  "context_sensitivity": "Preserve language that serves specific stylistic or characterization purposes"
}
```

**Phases Updated:**
- ✅ **Phase 2** (2_ai_word_cleaning.json:31-35)
- ✅ **Phase 10** (10_final_ai_word_sweep.json:54-58)

**Phases Already Had Framework:**
- Phase 1: Grammar Foundation
- Phase 3: Overwritten Language Reduction
- Phase 4: Sensory Enhancement
- Phase 5: Subtlety Creation
- Phase 6: Dialogue Enhancement
- Phase 6.1: Character Dialogue Pass
- Phase 7: Weak Language Cleanup
- Phase 8: Strategic Imperfections
- Phase 9: Final Verification

---

### Phase-Specific Clarifications

#### Phase 8: Strategic Imperfections
**Refined Focus:** Rhythm variation and strategic imperfections WITHIN existing sentences

**Clarifications Added:**
- Does NOT perform word filtering (Phases 2 & 10 handle this)
- Works on flow and pacing without changing content meaning
- May split/combine sentences and adjust word order
- MUST NOT change what's shown vs told (Phase 5's domain)
- Added master_prohibited_list_reference on line 88

**Updated Sections:**
- `success_criteria`: Changed from "Eliminated all prohibited words" to "Applied strategic imperfections and rhythm variations"
- `editing_principles`: Reworded to focus on rhythm rather than word replacement

---

#### Phase 9: Final Verification
**Clarified Role:** AI Pattern Detection (not word filtering)

**Key Distinctions from Phase 8:**

| Aspect | Phase 8: Strategic Imperfections | Phase 9: Final Verification |
|--------|----------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Approach** | Constructive - ADD natural rhythm | Reactive - DETECT AI patterns |
| **Focus** | Build natural flow into clean text | Find and fix AI-specific markers |
| **Method** | Vary sentence structure proactively | Pattern matching for AI indicators |
| **Analogy** | Interior designer (make lived-in) | Inspector (check for "showroom perfect") |

**Phase 9 Detection Frameworks:**
1. **AI Perfection Syndrome**
   - Unnaturally flawless grammar/punctuation
   - Uniform sentence lengths
   - Perfect metaphor consistency
   - Triplet pattern overuse (three examples everywhere)

2. **Phrase Repetition Patterns**
   - Scans for phrases (3+ words) appearing more than once
   - Creates frequency map
   - Varies repeated phrases with alternatives

3. **Linguistic Predictability**
   - Common AI phrases ("at its core", "that being said")
   - Overused transitions ("Furthermore", "Additionally")
   - Robotic qualifiers ("It should be emphasized")

4. **Perplexity Enhancement**
   - Unexpected word choices AI wouldn't predict
   - Surprising sentence constructions

---

### Master List References

All prompts now clearly reference master_prohibited_words.json:

**Phases with Direct Usage:**
- Phase 2: AI Word Cleaning - Uses master list with pattern rules
- Phase 10: Final AI Word Sweep - Uses master list with pattern rules

**Phases with Reference Note:**
- Phase 5: Notes Phases 2 & 10 handle filtering
- Phase 6: Notes Phases 2 & 10 handle filtering
- Phase 6.1: References master list
- Phase 7: References master list (keeps instructional examples)
- Phase 8: References master list
- Phase 9: Notes Phase 10 handles filtering

**Instructional Examples Preserved:**
- Phase 7 retains `target_language_categories` with examples of:
  - puff_words, empty_calorie_words, inflation_words
  - weasel_words, hedge_words, filter_phrases
  - cliches_buzzwords, formal_hedging, redundant_phrases
  - correlative_conjunctions, conversational_idioms
  - overused_transitions, robotic_qualifiers

These are teaching examples showing what patterns to detect, not filtering lists.

## Migration Guide

### From Previous Versions

**If you were using custom word lists in Phase 8:**
1. Move any custom words to `master_prohibited_words.json`
2. Phase 8 will automatically use them via Phase 10's final sweep

**If you were relying on Phase 9 for word filtering:**
1. No action needed - Phase 10 now handles this
2. Phase 9 focuses on AI pattern detection

**If you customized Phase 2's old_prohibited_list:**
1. Merge your custom entries into `master_prohibited_words.json`
2. Remove any local modifications to Phase 2's prompt

---

## Technical Improvements

### Memory Optimization
- Reduced duplicate word storage across phases
- Single master list loaded once (Phases 2 & 10 only)
- Phases 3-9 no longer load word lists unnecessarily

### Maintainability
- One list to update instead of multiple
- Prevents list drift between phases
- Clear separation of concerns (word filtering vs. domain processing)

### Consistency
- All prohibited words treated identically across all phases
- Pattern rules (dialogue pause, light, finger actions) applied uniformly
- No risk of missing words due to incomplete lists

---

## Breaking Changes

None. This update is backward compatible.

**Reason:** All changes are internal to prompt architecture. The external API, file structure, and usage patterns remain unchanged.

---

## Future Roadmap

### Planned Improvements
- [ ] Additional pattern rules in master_prohibited_words.json
- [ ] Phase 6.1 character templates for common archetypes
- [ ] Automated quality metrics dashboard
- [ ] Make.com workflow templates
- [ ] Zapier integration guides

### Under Consideration
- [ ] Phase 11: Genre-specific polish
- [ ] Optional Phase 6.2: Accent/dialect handling
