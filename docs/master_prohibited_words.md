## Pattern-Based Rules

### Punctuation Pattern Rules

**Description:** AI tends to overuse em dashes and en dashes for dramatic pauses or appositives. Replace with simpler punctuation.

**Detection Rule:** Any use of em dashes (—) or en dashes (–) in the text

**Prohibited Punctuation:**

—
–

**Replacement Strategy:**

**Preferred:** Replace em/en dashes with commas when setting off appositives or parenthetical information

**Simple Alternative:** Break into two separate sentences using a period

**Never Use:** Em dashes (—) in any context. These are AI-associated punctuation marks.

**Context Awareness:** Em and en dashes are rarely used in natural human writing. When they appear, they're usually a sign of AI-generated text trying to create dramatic pauses or connections.

**Examples:**

*Bad AI Writing:*

The proposal—despite its flaws—was accepted.
She arrived late–as usual–and missed the presentation.
The system—complex yet elegant—solved the problem.
He paused—considering his words carefully—before responding.

*Good Human Writing:*

The proposal, despite its flaws, was accepted.
She arrived late, as usual, and missed the presentation.
The system was complex yet elegant. It solved the problem.
He paused, considering his words carefully, before responding.

### Dialogue Pause Pattern Rules

**Description:** AI over-describes pauses in dialogue with flowery metaphors. Replace with simple, direct alternatives.

**Detection Rule:** Any metaphorical or elaborate description of a pause, silence, or gap in conversation between characters, OR any description that suggests unspoken tension/meaning hanging in the air

**Common AI Patterns:**

weight of * words
words hung *
words settled *
words lingered *
words echoed *
words filled the *
silence stretched *
silence hung *
silence settled *
comfortable silence
quiet hung *
pause hung *
pause stretched *
pause filled *
beat of silence
moment hung *
air between them *
air between us *
space between them *
gap filled with *
fell between *
question * in the air *
question hung *
loaded with implications
loaded with possibilities
loaded with possibility
thought hits me *
thought hit *

**Allowed Replacements:**

Silence.
Awkward silence.
A pause.
Neither spoke.
No one said anything.
[Remove the description entirely and just continue with the next dialogue or action]

**Examples:**

*Bad AI Writing:*

The weight of his words hung in the air between them.
Her words settled over the room like a heavy blanket.
Silence stretched between them, taut and uncomfortable.
The pause filled the space with unspoken tension.
The question hung in the air between us.
Her silence was loaded with implications.
Comfortable silence fell between them.
The thought hit me harder than it should.

*Good Human Writing:*

Silence.
Neither spoke.
[No pause description - just continue to next dialogue]
Awkward silence.
[Simply move to next action or dialogue without describing the pause]

### Light Description Pattern Rules

**Description:** AI over-describes light with elaborate filtering/casting/reflecting metaphors. Replace with simple, direct alternatives.

**Detection Rule:** Any description of light that uses verbs like 'filtering', 'casting', 'streaming', 'slanting', or elaborate metaphors for illumination

**Common AI Patterns:**

light filtered *
light filtering *
* filtering through *
* filtered through *
sunlight filtering *
sunlight streaming *
sunlight slanted *
sun filtered *
sun painted *
moonlight filtering *
moonlight reflecting *
morning light streams *
casting * shadows
cast * shadows
casting everything in gold
casting golden patterns
casting shadows
light slanted through *
afternoon light casts *

**Allowed Replacements:**

in the moonlight
in the sunlight
afternoon sun
morning sun
evening light
dim light
bright light
in the shadows
[Remove the light description entirely if not essential]

**Examples:**

*Bad AI Writing:*

Sunlight filtered through the dusty window.
The afternoon light cast everything in gold.
Moonlight filtering through the curtains illuminated her face.
Light slanted through the blinds, casting golden patterns on the floor.
Morning light streamed through the window.
The sun painted the room in warm hues.

*Good Human Writing:*

In the afternoon sun
The dusty window
In the moonlight
Morning sun
The bright room
[Remove light description - just describe the scene directly]

### Finger/Hand Action Pattern Rules

**Description:** AI over-describes finger/hand movements with elaborate verbs instead of simply naming the action. Replace with direct action verbs.

**Detection Rule:** Any description of fingers/hands doing an action that focuses on the finger movement rather than the action itself (especially typing, writing, touching)

**Common AI Patterns:**

fingers * moving
fingers are moving
fingers moved *
fingers dancing *
fingers danced *
fingers hovering *
fingers hovered *
fingers hung *
fingers traced *
fingers flew *
fingers drummed *
fingers glided *
hands dancing *
hands danced *
hands hovering *
hands flew *
running * fingers *
running his fingers *
running her fingers *
my finger hovers *
finger hovers over *

**Allowed Replacements:**

typing
stopped typing
typed
wrote
writing
touched
traced
tapped
clicked
pressed
[Use the actual action verb directly without describing finger movement]

**Examples:**

*Bad AI Writing:*

My fingers danced across the keyboard.
Her fingers hovered over the keys.
His fingers flew over the laptop.
Fingers moving, I typed out a response.
I ran my fingers along the edge of the table.
My finger hovers over the send button.

*Good Human Writing:*

I typed.
She paused.
He typed fast.
I typed a response.
I touched the table edge.
I hesitated.
My finger over the send button.

### Meta-Analytical Pattern Rules

**Description:** AI generates academic rhetorical analysis language that sounds formulaic and detached. Replace with direct, active descriptions.

**Detection Rule:** Any meta-analytical description of communication techniques, rhetorical devices, or persuasive strategies using academic terminology

**Common AI Patterns:**

builds/build [trust/credibility/ethos/rapport] by [verb]ing
[He/She/They] uses/use [logic/reason/emotion/pathos/ethos/logos] by [verb]ing
[possessive] [emotional/logical/rational] appeal comes through [verb]ing
appeals to [pathos/logos/ethos/emotion/logic/reason] by [verb]ing
establishes [trust/credibility/authority] through [verb]ing
creates [connection/rapport/bond] by [verb]ing
demonstrates [skill/expertise/knowledge] through [verb]ing
conveys [meaning/message/idea] through [verb]ing
achieves [effect/impact/result] by [verb]ing

**Allowed Replacements:**

Use direct, active verbs showing the action
Replace 'builds trust by showing confidence' with 'shows confidence'
Replace 'uses logic by explaining' with 'explains' or 'breaks down'
Replace 'appeal comes through presenting' with 'presents'
Replace 'achieves impact by demonstrating' with 'demonstrates'
Remove the meta-analytical framing entirely and just describe the action

**Examples:**

*Bad AI Writing:*

He builds trust by showing confidence in the technology.
She uses logic by explaining technical features in simple terms.
His emotional appeal comes through presenting the iPhone as life-changing.
Jobs appeals to pathos by positioning the product as transformative.
The speaker establishes credibility through demonstrating expertise.
She creates rapport by sharing personal anecdotes.
He achieves persuasive impact by combining facts with emotion.

*Good Human Writing:*

He shows confidence in the technology.
She explains technical features in simple terms.
He presents the iPhone as life-changing.
Jobs positions the product as transformative.
The speaker demonstrates expertise.
She shares personal anecdotes.
He combines facts with emotion.

### False Contrast Rhetorical Pattern Rules

**Description:** AI overuses the 'It's not X, it's Y' rhetorical device to create artificial tension and contrast. This construction prioritizes rhetoric over reasoning and becomes predictable in longer content.

**Detection Rule:** Any use of the 'It's not [about] X, it's [about] Y' construction or its variants that creates false dichotomies or forced contrasts

**Common AI Patterns:**

It's not about X. It's about Y.
It's not X. It's Y.
This isn't just X. It's Y.
This isn't about X. It's about Y.
It's not just about X. It's about Y.
This is not X. This is Y.
We're not X. We're Y.
I'm not X. I'm Y.
It isn't X. It's Y.
The point isn't X. It's Y.
The goal isn't X. It's Y.

**Why This Is Problematic:**

**Rhetoric Over Reasoning:** The construction prioritizes performative contrast over clear explanation of how X and Y actually relate

**Forced Tension:** Creates artificial tension-release cycles that manipulate rather than inform

**Frequency Spam:** Appears with such uniformity in AI content that it becomes a detectable signature

**False Dichotomy:** Often presents ideas as opposing when they're actually complementary or unrelated

**Cadence Signal:** The predictable rhythm signals AI-assisted content, especially in video essays and long-form writing

**Allowed Replacements:**

Use direct exposition: State what something IS without contrasting what it ISN'T
Use explicit causality: Explain the relationship between concepts directly
Use assisted inferences: Guide readers to conclusions without false contrast
Combine related ideas: Show how concepts work together rather than opposing them
Remove the construction entirely: Often the 'Y' statement alone is sufficient

**Examples:**

*Bad AI Writing:*

It's not about managing symptoms. It's about rewriting the narrative of the self.
This isn't just customer service. It's building relationships that last.
It's not just about fixing problems. It's about unlocking human potential.
We're not just selling products. We're creating experiences.
It's not about the destination. It's about the journey.
This isn't about technology. It's about people.
The point isn't perfection. It's progress.

*Good Human Writing:*

We rewrite the narrative of the self.
We build relationships that last.
We unlock human potential by solving problems.
We create experiences through our products.
The journey matters.
People drive our technology decisions.
Progress matters more than perfection.

## Contextual Patterns

## Note on Weak Language Patterns

**Description:** Weak language patterns (puff words, empty calorie words, inflation words, weasel words, hedge words, filter phrases, cliches, formal hedging, redundant phrases, conversational idioms, overused transitions, and robotic qualifiers) are handled exclusively by Phase 7

**Reference:** See 7_weak_language_cleanup.json for complete list of weak language patterns and examples

**Reason for Exclusion:** These patterns are only used by Phase 7 and are already embedded in that phase's prompt with full examples and guidance
