# **BANNED: THE DEFINITIVE GUIDE**

---

## **INTRODUCTION**

This document is a personal style guide—a catalog of words, phrases, constructions, and patterns that I don't want to see in my own writing. It exists because I got tired of catching the same problems in revision, and because working with AI tools requires explicit boundaries to prevent regression to generic, statistically-average prose.

I'm a content maximalist and a militant anti-tropist. My tolerance for cliché is low. My list of banned elements is long. Some of what's cataloged here represents genuinely weak writing—vague placeholders, dead metaphors, mechanical rhythms that substitute form for content. But some of it is simply personal preference: common literary constructs that work fine for other writers but that I find grating, overused, or tonally wrong for my projects.

This is not a universal prescription. It's not "if you use these, you're a bad writer." It's "if *I* use these, I've gotten lazy, and I need to fix it."

The document is organized into four parts:

* **Part 1: Constructions** — Syntactic and structural patterns to avoid  
* **Part 2: Words and Phrases** — Specific vocabulary and phrase-level bans  
* **Part 3: Guidelines** — Principles, protocols, and revision checklists  
* **Part 4: Erotica-Specific** — Additional rules governing explicit content

Use what applies. Ignore what doesn't. Adapt freely. The goal isn't compliance with my preferences—it's clarity about your own. If nothing else, this document might help you identify patterns you've never noticed, so you can decide for yourself whether they serve your work or undermine it.

Chew the meat. Spit out the bones.

# **PART 1: CONSTRUCTIONS**

## **Purpose**

This section catalogs **syntactic and structural patterns** that weaken prose through mechanical repetition, false rhythm, or decorative vagueness. These are not word-level problems—they're architectural habits that simulate depth, tension, or emotion without creating it.

**Core Principle:** Every construction listed here substitutes form for content. The fix is always the same: name what's actually happening, show consequence, or cut.

---

## **1.1 SEQUENTIAL ACTION PAIRS**

**Pattern:** "X, then Y"

**What It Looks Like:**

* "He stands, then sits."  
* "She speaks, then falls silent."  
* "He reaches out, then pulls back."

**Why It Fails:**

* Creates robotic pacing—every action reads identically  
* Removes emotional transition between gestures  
* Reads as stage direction rather than lived movement

**Flagging Trigger:** If you write ", then" between two actions, pause. Ask: Does this sequence reveal psychology, or am I just choreographing motion?

---

## **1.2 VAGUE INTERIORITY PLACEHOLDER**

**Pattern:** "Something \[verbs\] in/behind \[body part\]"

**What It Looks Like:**

* "Something shifts behind his eyes."  
* "Something tightens in her chest."  
* "Something flickers in his expression."  
* "Something hardens in her voice."

**Why It Fails:**

* "Something" signals the writer knows an effect occurred but can't specify what  
* Treats emotion as mysterious rather than observable  
* Creates false interiority—tells reader change happened without showing how

**Flagging Trigger:** If you write "something," stop. Ask: What exactly is happening? What would an observer see or the character feel?

---

## **1.3 ANTHROPOMORPHIZED SILENCE**

**Pattern:** "The silence \[verbs\]"

**What It Looks Like:**

* "The silence stretches between them."  
* "The silence sits heavy in the room."  
* "The silence grows uncomfortable."  
* "The silence hangs, thick and suffocating."

**Why It Fails:**

* Turns silence into an actor rather than showing its effect  
* Empty beat that simulates tension without creating it  
* Stops momentum by naming atmosphere instead of dramatizing consequence

**Flagging Trigger:** If silence "does" something (stretches, sits, presses, hangs), rewrite to show who breaks it, who endures it, what it costs.

---

## **1.4 NEGATION FORMULA**

**Pattern:** "Not X, but Y"

**What It Looks Like:**

* "Not angry, but resigned."  
* "Not a question, but a statement."  
* "Not love, but something close."  
* "Not fear, but caution."

**Why It Fails:**

* Hedges instead of commits  
* Signals authorial indecision  
* Becomes rhythmic tic—every nuanced feeling gets the same syntactic treatment

**Flagging Trigger:** If you write "not \[X\], but \[Y\]," ask: What is this actually? Can I name it directly?

---

## **1.5 TRIPLE-BEAT LISTS**

**Pattern:** Three-part noun/fragment sequences for emphasis

**What It Looks Like:**

* "The exhaustion. The loneliness. The endurance."  
* "The wine. The laughter. The silence."  
* "The blood. The breath. The waiting."

**Why It Fails:**

* Mimics poetic seriousness through structure, not content  
* Halts narrative flow for rhetorical effect  
* Once overused, becomes self-parody

**Flagging Trigger:** If you write three nouns/fragments in sequence for effect, ask: Am I building tension, or performing it?

---

## **1.6 STACCATO VERB FRAGMENTS**

**Pattern:** "\[Verb\]. \[Verb\]. \[Verb\]."

**What It Looks Like:**

* "Stops. Reaches. Retreats."  
* "Looks. Waits. Breathes."  
* "Turns. Pauses. Leaves."

**Why It Fails:**

* Overused in high-emotion beats until robotic  
* Creates artificial pacing, erasing natural movement  
* Pattern recognition kills power

**Flagging Trigger:** If you write three single-word verb sentences in a row, ask: Am I building tension, or mimicking it?

---

## **1.7 CONJUNCTION STARTS (OVERUSE)**

**Pattern:** Starting sentences with "And" or "But" for performative rhythm

**What It Looks Like:**

* "And she knows he's lying."  
* "But she can't walk away."  
* "And still, he waits."

**Why It Fails:**

* Over-reliance flattens voice  
* Creates false intimacy through affected cadence  
* Loses impact through repetition

**Flagging Trigger:** If you start with "And" or "But," ask: Does this sentence need dramatic separation, or am I forcing rhythm?

---

## **1.8 STANDALONE "BECAUSE" FRAGMENTS**

**Pattern:** "Because \[explanation\]." as its own sentence

**What It Looks Like:**

* "Because she can't bear to look."  
* "Because it's easier than lying."  
* "Because he's already gone."

**Why It Fails:**

* Imitates intimacy but signals shorthand thinking  
* Backfill explanation instead of lived cause  
* Tacks meaning onto flat line

**Flagging Trigger:** If you write "Because \[X\]" as a fragment, ask: Can I show this reason through action instead?

---

## **1.9 HEDGED REACTIONS**

**Pattern:** "A \[reaction\] that isn't quite \[itself\]"

**What It Looks Like:**

* "A laugh that isn't quite a laugh."  
* "A smile that isn't quite a smile."  
* "A sigh that isn't quite a sigh."  
* "A nod that isn't really agreement."

**Why It Fails:**

* Creates emotional static—reader can't visualize or feel the gesture  
* Substitutes contradiction for depth  
* Becomes nervous tic once pattern is recognized

**Flagging Trigger:** If you write "isn't quite \[X\]," stop. Ask: What is this gesture actually doing? What does it look like?

---

## **1.10 ECHO-LINE POETICS**

**Pattern:** Consecutive sentences with parallel structure for false depth

**What It Looks Like:**

* "He wanted to be touched. He wanted to be seen."  
* "She wasn't angry. She wasn't anything."  
* "It wasn't the silence. It was the waiting inside it."  
* "It hurt. God, it hurt."

**Why It Fails:**

* Artificial lyricism masking conceptual vacancy  
* Emotional tautology—repetition replaces actual thought or development  
* Second line rarely adds new information; just rephrases first line in adjacent terms

**Flagging Trigger:** If you write two consecutive sentences with mirrored structure, ask: Does the second line develop the first, or am I just creating rhythm?

---

## **1.11 MOOD-PROP NEGATION**

**Pattern:** Character performs action immediately negated as meaningless

**What It Looks Like:**

* "She grabs the soy sauce she doesn't need."  
* "He smoked a cigarette he didn't want."  
* "She stared at a scratch he didn't make."  
* "He drank tea he didn't really want."

**Why It Fails:**

* Signals complexity through subtraction, not concrete choice  
* Pretends specificity while revealing nothing  
* Becomes filler, avoiding real conflict

**Flagging Trigger:** If you write "\[action\] \+ \[negation\]," ask: Why is this character doing this? What does it reveal? If nothing, cut.

---

## **1.12 META-NARRATIVE INTRUSION**

**Pattern:** Narration referencing story mechanics from within the story

**What It Looks Like:**

* "Scene's not over."  
* "He waited for the next beat."  
* "This was the real moment."  
* "She knew the conversation wasn't finished."  
* "The air felt like something was about to happen."

**Why It Fails:**

* Breaks immersion—makes reader conscious of author's hand  
* Underlines narrative shape instead of letting it emerge

**Flagging Trigger:** If you write about "the scene" or "the moment" as structure, stop. You've left character POV. Reenter through action.

---

## **1.13 ATMOSPHERIC FRONT-LOADING**

**Pattern:** Scene opens with weather, skyline, or architecture before character presence

**What It Looks Like:**

* "The New York skyline glowed through the penthouse window, casting neon over the glass table."  
* "Rain traced the windows of the Tokyo apartment, the city lights flickering below."  
* "The waves crashed against the shore outside, the moonlight pooling across the floor."

**Why It Fails:**

* Begins with set dressing, not story  
* Creates distance when immediacy needed  
* Mimics film language rather than character consciousness  
* Filler buying time before committing to actual behavior

**Flagging Trigger:** If your first sentence could be read over a slow pan in a movie trailer, cut it. Start with character.

---

## **1.14 GRAVITATIONAL METAPHORS**

**Pattern:** Physics language for emotional connection

**What It Looks Like:**

* "Pulled toward her."  
* "Drawn to him."  
* "Orbits around her."  
* "The gravity between them."  
* "Magnetic."

**Why It Fails:**

* Turns attraction into automatism—robs relationships of will  
* Default metaphor for romantic connection  
* Ignores psychology in favor of pseudo-science

**Flagging Trigger:** If you write attraction as physics, stop. Make it a choice.

---

## **1.15 SUSPENSION PHRASES**

**Pattern:** "Hangs in the air" / "hangs between them"

**What It Looks Like:**

* "The words hang in the air."  
* "The silence hangs between them."  
* "The question hangs, unanswered."  
* "The accusation hangs there."

**Why It Fails:**

* Repetition numbs impact  
* "Hanging" creates stasis, not consequence  
* Suggests unresolved tension without showing what happens next

**Flagging Trigger:** If you write "hangs," ask: What happens because of this silence/question/moment? Show aftermath, not suspended atmosphere.

---

## **1.16 IMPACT SIMILES**

**Pattern:** "Like a \[physical force\]" for emotional shock

**What It Looks Like:**

* "Hit like a physical blow."  
* "Hit like a punch to the gut."  
* "Hit like a freight train."  
* "Landed like a slap."  
* "Knocked the air out of him."

**Why It Fails:**

* Relies on cliché rather than visceral description  
* Makes every revelation feel identical  
* Removes character-specific response

**Flagging Trigger:** If you write "like a blow," stop. Show the actual physical sensation instead.

---

## **1.17 RIPPLE/STILLNESS SIMILES**

**Pattern:** Water imagery for emotional impact

**What It Looks Like:**

* "Like a stone dropped in still water."  
* "Rippled through him."  
* "Sent ripples through the room."  
* "The stillness shattered."  
* "Cracked the silence like glass."

**Why It Fails:**

* Dead simile universalized to meaninglessness  
* No unique sensory or emotional anchor  
* So common it's invisible

**Flagging Trigger:** If you write "like a stone" or "rippled through," cut it. Show impact directly.

---

## **1.18 PRECISION/CONTROL CLUSTER**

**Pattern:** Overuse of clinical competence descriptors

**What It Looks Like:**

* "Surgical precision."  
* "With practiced ease."  
* "Economical movement."  
* "Calculated."  
* "Calibrated."  
* "Methodical."  
* "Clinical."  
* "Exacting."

**Why It Fails:**

* Reduces character to competence performance  
* Becomes shorthand for "impressive" without showing what's actually happening  
* Flattens distinct characters into same cool efficiency

**Flagging Trigger:** If you describe action as "precise" or "surgical," ask: What does this actually look like? What's the specific movement?

---

## **1.19 QUALITY/TEXTURE DEFAULTS**

**Pattern:** Same material metaphors for voice, tension, or restraint

**What It Looks Like:**

* "Velvet" (voice, darkness, threat)  
* "Silk over steel"  
* "Steel" (spine, voice, gaze, grip)  
* "Iron" (control, grip, will)  
* "Granite"  
* "Marble"

**Why It Fails:**

* So overused they're invisible  
* Every controlled character gets the same metallurgical description  
* No longer creates sensory impression

**Flagging Trigger:** If you reach for steel/iron/velvet/silk, find a different texture entirely—or describe the actual sensation.

---

## **1.20 BLANK DESIRE STATEMENTS**

**Pattern:** Desire expressed as appetite without psychological grounding

**What It Looks Like:**

* "He wanted her. God, he wanted her."  
* "She needed him like air."  
* "The wanting was unbearable."  
* "He ached for her."  
* "She craved him."

**Why It Fails:**

* Desire without motive reads as template—could apply to any character in any story  
* Reduces complex desire to generic biological drive  
* No differentiation between characters

**Flagging Trigger:** If you write "wanted her" or "needed him," ask: Wanted/needed what, specifically? For what purpose? What does this desire reveal?

---

## **1.21 ARTICULATION BY PROXY**

**Pattern:** Claiming communication happened without showing content

**What It Looks Like:**

* "He gave her a look that said everything."  
* "They didn't need words."  
* "She knew what he meant."  
* "The look they exchanged spoke volumes."  
* "His expression said it all."

**Why It Fails:**

* Admits narrative laziness—writer doesn't know what's being communicated  
* Pretends at intimacy while withholding actual subtext  
* Breaks the contract with reader: if communication happens, we should understand its content

**Flagging Trigger:** If you write "a look that said" or "didn't need words," ask: What is actually being communicated here? Can I show the exchange?

---

## **1.22 HOLLOW RESTRAINT**

**Pattern:** Describing containment without naming what's contained or what it costs

**What It Looks Like:**

* "He held it together."  
* "She swallowed it down."  
* "He kept it inside."  
* "She bottled it up."  
* "He locked it away."

**Why It Fails:**

* Vague abstraction of repression without psychological texture  
* Generic across all characters—everyone "holds it together" identically  
* What matters is what leaks when containment fails

**Flagging Trigger:** If you write about holding/containing emotion, ask: What exactly is being held? How is this character physically achieving restraint? What breaks if they stop?

---

## **1.23 AESTHETICIZED DAMAGE**

**Pattern:** Stylized dysfunction as character shorthand

**What It Looks Like:**

* "He poured another drink he didn't need."  
* "She hadn't slept in three days."  
* "The city ate people like him alive."  
* "Another sleepless night, another empty bottle."  
* "She lived on coffee and cigarettes and spite."

**Why It Fails:**

* Romanticizes burnout and alienation as aesthetic rather than lived reality  
* Substitutes darkness for depth  
* Performs suffering without dramatizing what it costs

**Flagging Trigger:** If you write about drinking, sleeplessness, or self-destruction, ask: Am I showing what this costs, or am I using it as character decoration?

---

## **1.24 FAUX-INTELLECTUAL APHORISM**

**Pattern:** Lines that sound profound but offer zero narrative content

**What It Looks Like:**

* "We are all just stories in the end."  
* "Maybe love was the real war."  
* "Sometimes, survival looks like surrender."  
* "Pain is just love with nowhere to go."  
* "The heart wants what it wants, even when it knows better."

**Why It Fails:**

* Performs insight without grounding in character experience  
* Breaks tonal realism—no one thinks in quotable one-liners during actual emotional crisis  
* Stops narrative momentum to deliver manufactured profundity

**Flagging Trigger:** If you write a line that sounds like it belongs on a motivational poster or could be retweeted as "deep thoughts," stop. Ask: Is this a real thought this specific character would have in this moment?

---

## **1.25 MISAPPLIED EPIC TONE**

**Pattern:** Heightened language treating minor moments as climactic

**What It Looks Like:**

* "In that instant, something in him broke forever."  
* "The world held its breath."  
* "It was only a touch, but it changed everything."  
* "Nothing would ever be the same."

**Why It Fails:**

* Every moment reads as climax—undermines proportion  
* Sounds algorithmically "important" rather than earned  
* Breaks psychological realism

**Flagging Trigger:** If you write "changed everything" or "broke forever," ask: Is this moment actually that big? If not, scale down.

---

## **1.26 ELEGANT VARIATION**

**Pattern:** Cycling through synonyms or descriptors to avoid repeating a character's name

**What It Looks Like:**

* "the older man" / "the younger woman" rotating with names  
* "the Japanese man" / "the dark-skinned woman" substituting for names  
* "his lover" / "her partner" / "the other man" used interchangeably  
* "the protagonist" / "the key player" / "the central figure"

**Why It Fails:**

* Draws attention to the writer avoiding repetition rather than to the scene  
* Creates distance—readers register descriptors as narrative intrusion  
* Flattens character into demographic marker or role  
* Signals AI generation through mechanical synonym cycling

**Flagging Trigger:** If you've used a descriptor instead of a name, ask: Would I notice this rotation as a reader? Is the descriptor doing work (establishing POV, power dynamic, emotional distance), or am I just avoiding the name?

**The Exception:** Descriptors are valid when they reveal POV or shift. "The man who used to be her husband" is doing work. "The tall man" rotating with "\[CHARACTER\]" is not.

---

## **1.27 FALSE RANGE CONSTRUCTION**

**Pattern:** "From X to Y" where X and Y aren't on the same measurable scale

**What It Looks Like:**

* "From the intimacy of their first kiss to the architecture of their silence"  
* "From heartbreak to revolution"  
* "From the weight of history to the lightness of her laugh"  
* "From pain to transformation to power"

**Why It Fails:**

* Sounds comprehensive but means nothing  
* No actual scale exists between the endpoints  
* Borrowed from persuasive/promotional writing where vagueness is a feature  
* Mimics profundity through syntactic shape rather than content

**Flagging Trigger:** If you write "from X to Y," ask: Can I identify a middle ground between these endpoints without switching to a different scale? If no, it's a false range. Cut it.

---

## **1.28 SUPERFICIAL ANALYSIS AS NARRATION**

**Pattern:** Present participle phrases attached to sentences to editorialize meaning

**What It Looks Like:**

* "She left the room, highlighting her frustration."  
* "He poured another drink, underscoring his exhaustion."  
* "They sat in silence, reflecting the distance between them."  
* "She touched his arm, emphasizing her concern."

**Why It Fails:**

* Narrator steps in to explain what the action means  
* Removes reader's role in interpreting behavior  
* The action should carry its own weight—if it doesn't, the action is wrong  
* Classic AI tell: inanimate facts/events "highlighting" or "underscoring" things

**Flagging Trigger:** If you attach a participle phrase that interprets the action (highlighting, underscoring, reflecting, emphasizing, showcasing, symbolizing), delete it. The action either speaks for itself or needs to be rewritten so it does.

---

## **1.29 NEGATIVE PARALLELISM**

**Pattern:** "Not only... but..." or "It's not about X, it's about Y" constructions

**What It Looks Like:**

* "It wasn't just the silence—it was everything the silence contained."  
* "Not only had she lost him, but she had lost herself."  
* "It's not about the money. It's about respect."  
* "He didn't just leave. He erased himself."

**Why It Fails:**

* Performs profundity through syntactic opposition  
* The second clause often restates the first in inflated terms  
* Halts narrative momentum for rhetorical emphasis  
* Overused in AI output as a depth-simulation device

**Flagging Trigger:** If you write "not only... but" or "it's not about X, it's about Y," ask: Is the second clause adding information, or just amplifying? Can I cut the construction and state the point directly?

---
